The resume is also a great way to capture and organize, neatly and concisely, your\nskills and experience which will be very useful when it comes time to interview. The resume is the primary tool of your job\nsearch and may take several drafts to prepare effectively.\nResumes must do their work quickly. Employers or Human Resources personnel may look through hundreds of resumes for a\nparticular position and may spend only a few seconds reviewing each. To get someone to look at it longer, your resume must\nconvey quickly that you are capable and competent enough to be worth an interview. Employers use this tool to screen potential\ncandidates before granting interviews, so the goal is to use the resume to entice the employer to want to meet you. The more\nthoroughly you prepare your resume now, the more likely someone is to read it later.\n\nCOMPONENTS OF A RESUME\nThere are four basic styles of resumes:\nREVERSE-CHRONOLOGICAL\nAlso called simply \xe2\x80\x9cChronological,\xe2\x80\x9d this is the most common resume format. It\xe2\x80\x99s also the simplest to create. Education\nand Experience are each listed by category, in reverse-chronological (most recent first) order. The chronological\nresume is usually best for undergraduates and entry-level candidates. This handout will focus primarily on the\nchronological resume format.\nFUNCTIONAL (experience sorted by relevance to career objective)\nA functional resume differs from a chronological resume by concentrating on skills that you have used that relate to\nyour stated objective rather than on the jobs you have had.\nA functional resume is particularly effective if your work experience has not been closely related to your job objective, if\nyou are changing careers, or if you are seeking a promotion. In this format you elaborate on the skills necessary to\nperform the desired job and how you have demonstrated those same skills in different types of jobs.\nBecause the Functional Resume is not recommended for most entry-level candidates, it will not be described in detail in\nthis handout.\nCOMBINATION\nThe combination chronological/functional resume uses elements of both styles. The qualifications (areas of\neffectiveness) of the functional resume remain within specific job/experience descriptions. The jobs/experiences are\nthen grouped and categorized to show the strengths in two to four categories. This resume format is effective if at least\nsome of your experience is related to the job objective, and also when the job objective has more than one component\nand you have experience in these different components (e.g., technical and management; sales and organizational).\nBecause the Combination Resume is not recommended for most entry-level candidates, it will not be described in detail\nin this handout.\nCURRICULUM VITAE\nAlso called a \xe2\x80\x9cCV,\xe2\x80\x9d this is a highly specialized resume format used by those individuals seeking a teaching and/or\nresearch position in a postsecondary institution or high-level research industry. Information in all categories should be in\nreverse chronological order (the most recent data first).\n\n3\n\n\x0cCreating your Chronological Resume:\nI.\n\nHeader\nYour contact information\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Your name should be the biggest item on the page and be on its own line\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use an address where you can receive correspondence\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Supply the phone number whose line offers you the most privacy for you to speak professionally on (ensure you\nhave a PROFESSIONAL greeting on your answering machine)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Include your e-mail address\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DO NOT list your age, gender, religion, political affiliation, marital status, health status or social security number\n\nII.\n\nObjective\nA clear and concise statement that can communicate the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The position or field you desire and your long term goals\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The position or field you are pursuing and the skills you wish to use\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The position or field you desire and the responsibilities you are seeking\n\xe2\x80\xa2 REMEMBER \xe2\x80\x93 a poor objective can hurt a resume. Be sure NOT to use vague, general statements (e.g, \xe2\x80\x9cElectrical\nengineering graduate looking to apply leadership and technical skills to a challenging position with potential for\ngrowth.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nIII.\n\nEducation\nWhere you can indicate your educational and academic background\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Name of Institution, City, State\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Type of degree: Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, Ph.D.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Date of graduation or anticipated graduation date\nAdditional Sub-headings under Education could be:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Academic Projects: especially Senior Design Project which can be a separate sub-heading\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Related Coursework: 4-6 courses that relate to the employer and/or position, no more than 8\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Honors: Deans List, with semesters, Honor Societies, Scholarships, Awards, Academic Honors, etc.\nOptional information could be:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GPA if 3.0 or above (general rule of thumb, if GPA is not above a 3.0, do not include it)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fundamentals of Engineering Exam can be phrased: \xe2\x80\x9cCertified Engineer-in-Training, Date\xe2\x80\x9d once you\xe2\x80\x99ve passed\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hours worked to finance ___% of your education\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Any relevant seminars or workshops you\xe2\x80\x99ve attended\n\nIV.\n\nExperience\nInformation that should be included:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Name of company\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Location of company, city, state\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dates of employment\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Job Titles and if applicable, department\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide a brief job description (bulleted list or short paragraph), using appropriate action verbs that emphasize your\nstrengths. Make sure you use the proper verb tense.\no Focus on your significant achievements and contributions\no Focus on how you saved the employer time and money\no QUANTIFY your accomplishments whenever possible\nFor example: \xe2\x80\x9cProject scheduled for 49 days completed in 27\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSoftware enhancements cut required\npurchase processing time by 38 percent\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf applicable, you can divide your work experience into two categories: \xe2\x80\x9cExperience\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9cRelated Experience\xe2\x80\x9d) and\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdditional Experience\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9cOther Experience\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\n4\n\n\x0cV.\n\nSkills\nThere are three different skill sets that can be listed as sub-headings under \xe2\x80\x9cSkills\xe2\x80\x9d or be their own main heading.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Computer Skills: List ALL computer skills in some type of order\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Language Skills: If need be, you can break these out into \xe2\x80\x9cFluent in\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cConversational in\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lab Skills\n\nVI.\n\nActivities/Affiliations\nList any memberships or affiliations you have, indicating any offices held and achievements related to these activities.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Membership in an engineering society, honor societies, student organizations, etc.\n\nVII.\n\nInterests (not essential)\nThis section is used to show that you are a well-rounded individual. List any hobbies or interests that you feel might\nadd \xe2\x80\x9cspice\xe2\x80\x9d to your profile. Make sure that the information you provide is appropriate and useful.\n\nVIII.\n\nOther Possible Section Headings\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Citizenship\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Military Experience\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPublications and/or Patents held or pending\nVolunteer/Community Activities\n\nTHE GLANCE TEST\nTo make sure your resume looks flawless and noticeable, you want to make sure that your resume will pass the glance test.\nYou should ask yourself these questions when preparing for the glance test:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIs your format consistent throughout the resume?\no If you use periods, use periods throughout.\no Use the same bullets throughout.\no If indenting, indent the same amount each time.\no Make sure top and bottom margins are equal and right and left margins are equal.\no Use standard typefaces such as Arial, Helvetica, Universe, Times, Palatino, Century, and Courier.\no Use a font size of 10 to 14 points. (Avoid Times New Roman 10 point).\no Avoid fancy treatments such as italics, underline, shadows, and reverse (white letters on black background).\no Avoid vertical and horizontal lines, graphics, and boxes.\no Avoid two-column format or resumes that look like newspapers or newsletters.\no List each phone number and e-mail on its own line.\nDo you have too much or not enough white space?\no You want to make sure that you format the resume so that the white space is kept to a minimum, while not\noverwhelming the reader with too much text.\nDoes your resume look symmetrical?\nHave you SPELL-CHECKED? There is NO excuse for a misspelled word and recruiters may view it as laziness\nAre you utilizing action verbs? (A list of actions verbs can be found on page 7)\nHave you proofread?\n\nOnce you\xe2\x80\x99ve answered these questions to your satisfaction and corrected any problems found, proceed with the glance test.\nHold your resume in front of you for ten seconds\xe2\x80\xa6does it look good, are you satisfied with your work?\n\n5\n\n\x0cOTHER MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWhen writing numbers, numbers one \xe2\x80\x93 ten should be spelled out, numbers 11, 12, 13, 14\xe2\x80\xa6can be written using\nthe number symbol.\nWhen describing your past experience, use verbs written in the past tense (Designed). When describing your\npresent experience, use present-tense verbs (Design).\n\nWHAT NOT TO PUT ON A RESUME\nThere are certain pieces of information that you should never include on your resume. These include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Your social security number. Who knows who\xe2\x80\x99s hands your resume could fall into? Identity theft is a very real problem,\nand they don\xe2\x80\x99t need your SSN until after you\xe2\x80\x99ve been hired, anyway.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Personal information that could be used to discriminate against you. An employer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to know your age, race,\nreligion, gender, marital status, whether or not you have kids, your nation of origin, your weight, your height, your sexual\norientation, or your politics. None of that has anything to do with your ability to carry out the requirements of the\njob. It\xe2\x80\x99s illegal for employers to even ask you for that information while you\xe2\x80\x99re applying, so you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t volunteer the\ninformation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 References. The only person who\xe2\x80\x99s name should be on your resume is yourself. It\xe2\x80\x99s good to have references that you\ncan give to an employer when they ask, but they should always be on a separate document, which you give to the\nemployer only after they\xe2\x80\x99ve asked. It\xe2\x80\x99s common to conclude a resume with \xe2\x80\x9cReferences Available Upon Request,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with including that if you have room, but it\xe2\x80\x99s generally assumed by most employers that you can\nprovide references when asked.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Anything negative. Did you get fired from a previous job? Did you get laid off because your boss ran the company into\nthe ground? Do you hate eating your vegetables? Whatever it is, keep it to yourself. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to look like a\ncomplainer, and you certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to look like a backstabber. Only provide positive information about yourself,\nand never badmouth a previous employer, even if working for them was the worst experience of your entire life.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 First person pronouns. Using words like \xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cme,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmy,\xe2\x80\x9d etc, just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look very professional. Avoid them, which\nshould be easier if you\xe2\x80\x99re making an effort to start sentences with verbs. The only place it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to use a first\nperson pronoun is in your Objective statement or possibly referring to \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d on a group project, but try to avoid it.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Your picture. You\xe2\x80\x99re applying for a professional position, not auditioning for a TV show. They don\xe2\x80\x99t need a headshot.\n\nRECRUITERS\xe2\x80\x99 TOP 10 RESUME PET PEEVES\nRecently, ResumeDoctor.com1 asked more than 2,500 recruiters from a variety of industries what their pet peeves were when\nit comes to resumes:\n1.) Spelling Errors, Typos and Poor Grammar \xe2\x80\x93 make sure you spell-check AND proofread\n2.) Too Duty-Oriented \xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t just write the company\xe2\x80\x99s summary of your position, explain your accomplishments\n3.) Inaccurate Dates or None at All \xe2\x80\x93 this missing or inaccurate information could send up red flags\n4.) Inaccurate or Missing Contact Information \xe2\x80\x93 if a recruiter can\xe2\x80\x99t reach you they will move on to someone else\n5.) Poor Formatting\n6.) Functional Resumes\n7.) Long Resumes \xe2\x80\x93 too much information will simply waste a recruiter\xe2\x80\x99s time\n8.) Long Paragraphs \xe2\x80\x93 stay focused and concise\n9.) Unqualified Candidates\n10.) Personal Information Unrelated to the Job\n\n6\n\n\x0cACTION VERBS\nGood use of action verbs can mean the difference when it comes to getting your foot in the door and being invited for an interview.\nRemember, a hiring manager probably sees dozens of resumes for each position they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to fill, each with a similar list of skills and\nexperience. The key is to make sure yours gets noticed. When describing experience, try to start each sentence with an action verb.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t use the same verb repeatedly, and don\xe2\x80\x99t limit yourself to this list.\nA-B: accelerated,

Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a\ngreat place to start when composing your resume. This list is a sampling of the types of\nskills you might highlight on your resume, in addition to those skills that are more\nspecific to your major, intended industry, or job function.\nA sampling of action verbs is also included on this page. Be sure to use strong action\nverbs to begin each of your bulleted statements, previewing the skill to be exemplified\nthrough the accomplishment statement.\n\nIV.\n\nChronological Resume Samples...\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6...Pages 6-11\nIn this most commonly accepted resume format, job titles and employers are\nemphasized, starting with your most recent experiences to illustrate a progressive work\nhistory. Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements\nunder each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently\ngraduated with a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree, those who are staying within the same career field,\nand candidates with few time gaps in their job history. This type is most often preferred\nby employers because it is easy to scan, highlights job titles, employers, and dates, and\nclearly ties candidates\xe2\x80\x99 skills and accomplishments to their work histories.\n\nV.\n\nFunctional & Combination Resume Samples...\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6..Pages 12-13\nThis format is an option for candidates who have changed employers frequently,\nhave gaps in their employment history, or are hoping to transition to a new industry\nor unrelated job function. Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight\ntransferable skills, placing less emphasis on employment dates, job titles, and\nemployers.\n\nVI.\n\nAdditional Career Center Resume Resources\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6...Page 14\n\n2\n\n\x0cI. Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics\nThe purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience,\nand skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume,\nthink of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect\ncandidate for the opportunity at hand.\nResume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best\npractices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content\nand a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with\nregard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify\nthe skills you possess and employers are seeking.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should\nkeep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing\nelements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the reader\xe2\x80\x99s eye to rest.\nUsing .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A\n10-12 point font size is recommended.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold\na job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers,\ndates, etc. line up neatly on the page.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully\nread through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least\n2-3 people proofread it as well.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when\nyou have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties,\nquantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry\nor job function-specific) and transferable skills.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the\nskill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily\nscan your resume for what he or she is seeking.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d at the beginning of each bullet point as this is\nassumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \xe2\x80\x9cMy duties included...\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMy responsibilities\nwere\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xef\x81\xb6 Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking.\nAlso, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your\nmost important information stands out.\n\n3\n\n\x0cII. Key Elements of a Successful Resume\nYour First and Last Name\n\xe2\x99\xa6 Phone number \xe2\x99\xa6 Email address \xe2\x99\xa6 Street address \xe2\x99\xa6 City, state & zip code \xe2\x99\xa6\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOBJECTIVE\nCreate a statement describing or naming the position you are seeking to obtain. You may also include the specific field or area\nyou are interested in and the skills and expertise you could contribute to the company. This section is optional and could be\nomitted or substituted with a \xe2\x80\x95Career Highlights\xe2\x80\x96 or \xe2\x80\x95Summary of Qualifications\xe2\x80\x96 section.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEDUCATION\nInstitution City, State\n(Expected) Graduation Month Year\nWrite out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations\nGPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher)\nOther possible information to include: Study Abroad experiences, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEXPERIENCE, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE [possible titles/descriptive headings]\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nThe position header above is one example of formatting. Other formats can include using two lines or rearranging the order of\nthe Organization, Job Title, Location, and Dates to emphasize the most important elements.\nYou can bold or italicize your title or your organization\xe2\x80\x94whichever is more relevant, but be consistent.\nIn this section include bulleted accomplishment statements, which provide examples of times you have successfully used the\nskills employers are seeking.\nStart with a strong action verb, then follow with an explanation of what you were doing, describe how you did it, and, when\npossible, include any outcomes that you achieved. Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or\nmore skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them.\nConsider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work?\nWhat were your accomplishments? How did you help the organization? What skills/knowledge did you enhance? How does\nthis experience relate to your internship/employment goal?\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nBulleted statements should be in the proper tense (past or present tense) and use consistent grammar and punctuation.\nBe specific by including quantity, frequency, population, and impact of your work whenever possible.\nMake sure your resume is easy to read and not too text heavy. Avoid using colors, multiple fonts, pictures, being too brief, or\nmaking it too dense. Make it your own, but be professional.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, LEADERSHIP, HONORS, ACTIVITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE, VOLUNTEER,\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT [possible titles/descriptive headings]\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nUsing multiple experience sections is optional and allows you to emphasize (by placing it closer to the top) your most relevant\nexperience. Experiences within a section should be listed in reverse chronological order.\nPositions within this section should be formatted like previous experience sections, but may or may not include bullet points.\nIn an additional experience section, you can include work experiences that may not be directly related to the job you are\napplying to, but add to your credibility by exemplifying a progressive work history.\nEmphasize your transferable skills, those that can be taken from one experience and applied elsewhere.\nOrganization, Your Role (e.g. Member, Participant, Honoree, or Presenter) \xe2\x80\x93 City, State Month Year - Month Year\nThis section can also be an opportunity to share your experiences as a leader, honors received, community involvement,\nprofessional development activities, or membership in organizations. As illustrated, replace \xe2\x80\x95job title\xe2\x80\x96 with the role you played.\nIncluding bullet points is optional, depending on what you wish to convey to a potential employer.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nADDITIONAL SKILLS [List skills that are testable and concrete. Soft skills such as communication, organizational, and\ninterpersonal skills should not be listed here, but rather incorporated into your bulleted accomplishment statements above.]\nTechnology: Try to include programs that would not be assumed based on education and include your proficiency level. For\nexample: Advanced User of Microsoft Office Suite, including Outlook, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as Adobe Photoshop.\nLanguages: For example: Proficient in oral and written German; Beginner knowledge of Spanish.\n\n4\n\n\x0cIII. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs\nTRANSFERABLE SKILLS\nTransferable skills are those that can be applied in multiple work settings. Consider incorporating them, in addition to those\nthat are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your\nbulleted accomplishment statements.

It should also help the\nemployer understand how these qualifications/experiences relate to their hiring needs.\nResume writing is both a skill and an art form. Writing a resume requires careful consideration, strategy, and\nconstruction each time you apply for a new position. This means every time you submit an application, you will need to\nwrite an altered resume tailored to each specific position.\nDO NOT PANIC! While it may seem like a lot of work in the beginning, the more you practice, the easier writing effective\ntailored resumes will become. This guide will help you learn the major elements of effective resume writing and walk you\nthrough the process of constructing a strong professional document.\nThe General Rules of Resume Writing\n1. Resumes should not be a step by step recap of everything you have ever done. Rather, it is a document that\nhighlights the most relevant skills and experiences as they relate to the position for which you are applying.\n2. Resumes should be written in the third person. Never use references to yourself in the first person, i.e. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cMe,\xe2\x80\x9d\nor \xe2\x80\x9cMy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n3. Resumes for undergraduates should be confined to one page.* Resumes for professionals with a wealth of\nexperience or with education levels of master\xe2\x80\x99s degrees or higher should be no longer than two pages.*\n*The exception to this rule is Federal resume writing\n4. In the United States, resumes should not contain personal information regarding race, ethnicity, sex, gender,\nreligious affiliation (unless affiliation is professional in nature), or age. Never include a picture on your resume.\n5. The use of color and graphics is discouraged for all resumes except those submitted in design or arts industries.\nFormatting\n\xef\x82\xb7 Your name should be the largest font size of the document (16 \xe2\x80\x93 18 pt. recommended) and can be in any style you\nchoose as long as it is READABLE (refrain from using script fonts).\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nYour contact information can be smaller (10 pt. font).\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nIf your email address is automatically made into a hyperlink, remove the hyperlink by highlighting the email\naddress, right clicking, and selecting \xe2\x80\x9cremove hyperlink\xe2\x80\x9d from the drop down list.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nFont size for the body of the document should be either 11 or 12 pt. in an easy-to-read style (i.e. Times New\nRoman, Arial, Verdana).\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nWatch for spacing\xe2\x80\x94be sure that all spacing between sections is consistent.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nDates should all align on the RIGHT side of the page.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nList all experiences within a section uniformly.\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cExample:\nGOOD!\nEXPERIENCE\nVolunteer, Society for Human Resources Management\nMay 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 June 2013\nArlington, VA\n\xef\x82\xb7 Provided technical support to office of 20 staff members\n\xef\x82\xb7 Performed administrative duties such as filing, answering phones, and organizing on-line drives\nIntern, Very Important Company LLC\nMay 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 May 2013\nSilver Spring, MD\n\xef\x82\xb7 Served as administrative assistant to HR coordinator\n\xef\x82\xb7 Assisted in the hiring process for 10 new employees; conducted interviews, reviewed employee\nassessments, and maintained accurate employee files\n\nInconsistent\nCan you find the errors?\n\nEXPERIENCE\nVolunteer, Society for Human Resources Management, Arlington, VA\nMay 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 06/2013\n\xef\x82\xb7 Provided technical support to office of 20 staff members\n\xef\x82\xb7 Performed administrative duties such as filing, answering phones, and organizing on-line drives\nVery Important Company LLC, Intern\nMay 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 May 2013\nSilver Spring, MD\n\xef\x82\xb7 Served as administrative assistant to HR coordinator\n\xef\x82\xb7 Assisted in the hiring process for 10 new employees; conducted interviews, reviewed employee\nassessments, and maintained accurate employee files\n\nCONTENT CONSTRUCTION\n1.

Below, you will find a list of\nrequired sections as well as additional sections you may want to consider depending on your experience and industry.\nContact Information (Required)\nContact information should be the section at the very top of the resume that includes your name, telephone number,\nemail address, and postal address.

The objective should be a one to two sentence description of the kind of position you are\nlooking to obtain. If you choose to include this section, be sure to specify the kind of industry and work you would like to\ndo. Try not to be so general that the objective is unclear, but at the same time, not so specific that an employer can use\nthe objective to screen you out of the hiring process.\nExample:\n\xef\x82\xb7 \xe2\x80\x9cSeeking an accounts specialist position at JP Morgan Chase\xe2\x80\x99s Arlington office.\xe2\x80\x9d\no Too specific! This objective tells the employer that you only want a position as an accounts specialist\nand only in one branch office. If there is a similar position in a different office, you may not be\nconsidered.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeking an internship position.\xe2\x80\x9d\no Too general! This objective does not add any value to your resume as it does not clarify industry or\nexperiences you are looking to gain.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeking an entry level accounting position in top tier financial services firm with opportunities to both work\nwith a diverse client base and gain experience in corporate accounts. \xe2\x80\x9c\no Good! A nice balance of the general industry interests and experiences the person is seeking without\nlimiting what they might be considered for.\n\nQUALIFICATION HIGHLIGHTS/ PROFESSIONAL PROFILE (Optional)\nThis section can be either a bulleted list or a paragraph summarizing your best qualities and most relevant experiences.\nThis section gives the employer a general sense of how you are qualified for this position as well as how well your\nprevious experiences have prepared you for the kind of work you may be performing in your new position.\nQUALIFICATION HIGHLIGHTS\n\xef\x82\xb7 Motivated Fashion major with experience working in both the design and\nmerchandising areas of the Fashion industry.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Strong teamwork and leadership skills with ability to communicate effectively in\nverbal and written formats.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Specialized skills in constructing wedding gowns and formal women\xe2\x80\x99s wear\n\nOR\nPROFESSIONAL PROFILE\nAspiring public relations professional with radio and television broadcast media\nexperience. Strong organizational, communication, and multi-tasking abilities with\nproven successes managing multiple projects and events. Hard-working and motivated\nindividual with results-oriented perspective and commitment to excellence in customer\nsatisfaction.\n\nEDUCATION (Required)\nThis section should include any educational experiences you have completed or are currently completing AFTER HIGH\nSCHOOL. High school should not be included on a resume once a student has entered college. Items to include in the\neducation section include the kind of degree you are obtaining (e.g. Bachelor of Arts), major and/or minor, the date you\nexpect to graduate, name of your school, location of school (city and state only unless outside the USA), and GPA if it is 3.0\nor higher (if not, do not include). Relevant coursework and study abroad experiences can also be included here.\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cEDUCATION\nBachelor of Science in Nursing, Degree Expected: May 2015\nMarymount University, Arlington, VA; GPA: 3.7\nOR\nEDUCATION\nB.A. in Business Administration, concentration in Finance, Minor in Math\nMarymount University, Arlington, VA; GPA: 3.2\nStudy Abroad: \xe2\x80\x9cEuropean Finance\xe2\x80\x9d in London, England\nRelevant Coursework: Accounting, Finance I, Advanced Economics\n\nExpected: 05/14\nSummer 2013\n\nEXPERIENCE (Required)\nThe experience section (or sections) of the resume is the area where a person should list previous experiences in which\nthey have formally utilized or demonstrated work-related skills and abilities. These experiences can be formal job\nexperiences, volunteer experiences, leadership experiences, or internship experiences. To include an experience, one\nshould be able to associate a title with it (e.g. \xe2\x80\x9cVolunteer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPresident,\xe2\x80\x9d or formal job title). Experiences should be listed\nin reverse chronological order (most recent to least recent) and should be formatted uniformly. It is okay to have more\nthan one experience section (e.g. a \xe2\x80\x9cRELEVANT EXPERIENCE\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE\xe2\x80\x9d section or \xe2\x80\x9cWORK\nEXPERIENCE\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cVOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE\xe2\x80\x9d section), but be sure to list the most relevant experiences first.\nThe experience description should include the title of your position, the name and location of your\ncompany/organization, start and end dates (including month and year) and no less than two bullet points or sentences\ndescribing a skill, knowledge set, ability, qualification, or recognition/award received. Bullet points should emphasize\ntransferable skills and should be no longer than 2 sentences (ideally only one sentence). If you have more than one\nexperience section, additional experience sections may not require bullet points.\nEXPERIENCE\nCashier, The Juice Factory\n05/2011 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nArlington, VA\n\xef\x82\xb7 Demonstrated strong communication skills while interacting with and serving customers\n\xef\x82\xb7 Exercised efficient time management when completing multiple tasks in fast-paced service\nenvironment\nOR \xef\x82\xb7 Recognized as \xe2\x80\x9cEmployee of the Month\xe2\x80\x9d for July 2011, March 2012, and January 2013\nRELATED EXPERIENCE\nGraphic Design Intern, CoolArts Inc.\nJanuary 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nVienna, VA\n\xef\x82\xb7 Developed creative print marketing ads utilizing specialized design software\n\xef\x82\xb7 Designed web portfolio for 3 resident artists resulting in increase in client business\n\xef\x82\xb7 Assisted management in redesigning company logo\nADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE\nStudent Assistant, Lee Center at Marymount University\nArlington, VA\nWaitress, Rock Bottom Brewery\nArlington, VA\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\nSeptember 2011 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\n\nMay 2011 \xe2\x80\x93 September 2011\n\n\x0cConstructing the bullet points or sentence descriptions of your experiences may seem a bit tricky at first. To help\nyou get used to this style of writing, keep in mind that every bullet point should have three major components:\nAn action verb to start the bullet, the skill you are trying to emphasize, and the tasks that evidence your ability to\nperform that skill.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nDemonstrated strong communication skills while interacting with and serving customers\nAction Verb\nSkill\nTasks\n\nConstruct your bullet points by following these steps:\nStep 1: Identify the skill/ability/qualification, etc. you would like to describe and write it down. To decide which skills\nto describe, you can use a variety of different methods.\na) Go to the job posting/description of the position for which you are applying. Underline or highlight the skills\nthe employer is looking for in an ideal candidate for this position. Identify the skills that you feel you most\nstrongly possess and write bullet points around those skills. If your job has no job posting, use an online\nsearch engine like www.simplyhired.com or www.indeed.com to look for similar positions and use the key\nskills emphasized in these postings. If you would like a more comprehensive list of job search engines by\nindustry, visit our website at www.marymount.edu/careerservices.\nb) Using the job title for which you are applying, do some research using www.onetonline.org or\nwww.bls.gov/ooh. These websites outline and describe thousands of job titles in the USA and specifically list\nthe kinds of skills and abilities required to effectively perform these jobs.\nc) Perform an informational interview (See Networking and Personal Branding E-Guide for more information\non this kind of interview) with an industry professional either in a job similar to the job for which you are\napplying or in a position that supervises the kind of job for which you are applying and inquire as to what\nkinds of skills and abilities are most important for that job.\nd) Look at the transferable skills list towards the end of this e-guide.\nStep 2: Think about the tasks and duties you performed in your experience that effectively evidence your ability to\nperform this skill. Write these down in a list on a separate sheet of paper.\nExample:\nPrevious position title: Student Front Desk Assistant\nSkill: Communication\nTasks:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Talked with customers at the front desk\n\xef\x82\xb7 Answered phones\n\xef\x82\xb7 Wrote emails to clients\nStep 3: Choose an action verb that helps the employer understand how or in what way you used or demonstrated this\nskill (See list of action verbs at the back of this document for help). Note that action verbs should be in\nPRESENT TENSE if you are currently working in the listed position and PAST TENSE if you are no longer working\nin the listed position.\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cExample:\nSkill: Communication\nSample Action Verbs:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nExercised communication skills\nUtilized communication skills\nDemonstrated communication skills\n\nStep 4: Write your bullet point!\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nExercised communication skills when talking with customers, answering phones and writing\nemails to clients.\n\nGreat! Now you have written an effective bullet point. It is strong as it is, however you can make it even stronger by\nadding in some additional descriptors like adjectives and quantifiers (a.k.a. numbers) to clarify your skills, communicate\ncompetence, or emphasize a positive result of your actions. Use adjectives cautiously! Stay away from claims of\nexcellence like \xe2\x80\x9cAmazing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSuperb,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cExcellent,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. as these adjectives may be perceived as an indication of\narrogance rather than confidence. For a list of strong adjectives, see our adjective list at the back of this document.\nAdjective\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nQuantifiers\n\nExercised strong communication skills when talking with 20+ customers per day,\nanswering phones, and writing emails to clients.\n\nRESEARCH and/or PROJECTS (Optional)\nThis is a section commonly used by students to help show employers relevant academic work that has allowed them to\ndevelop skills the employer values. You can include any research papers, individual or group projects, and presentations\non relevant topics in this section. The description should include the title of the project or paper, the semester(s) date in\nwhich it was completed, the name of the school/organization at which it was conducted/completed, the location of the\nschool/organization, and a 2-3 sentence description of the project, skills used, and results. If you are going to list a group\nproject, make sure to clearly state that it was a group project. You must not take credit for the work of others.\n\nPROJECTS/RESEARCH\nSenior Seminar Business Project (Group Project)\nFall 2012\nMarymount University, Arlington, VA\n\xef\x82\xb7 Exercised effective team work skills while collaborating with group of 6 students to develop\nbusiness plan for hypothetical manufacturing company. Conducted formal oral presentation to\nSchool of Business; received grade of \xe2\x80\x9cA.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSKILLS (Required)\nThe Skills section should be reserved for concrete technical and language skills only. Computer applications you are\nfamiliar with and foreign language proficiencies should be listed here (name of language and proficiency level: basic,\nintermediate, advanced, and fluent). Note that for IT majors, this section will be much more extensive and include several\nsubheadings for additional technical proficiencies (e.g. applications, browsers, languages, etc.) For certain majors,\nincluding social media proficiencies (Facebook/Twitter/Pinterest) may also be a good idea. If you have no foreign language\nskills, simply do not list.\nSKILLS\nTechnical:\nLanguage:\n\nMicrosoft Office Suite, Photo Shop, Types 45 WPM\nFluent in French, Basic Spanish\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cACTIVITIES/HONORS/AFFILIATIONS (Optional, but strongly recommended)\nThis section is where you should place any extracurricular activities (e.g. club membership, college sports, community\nservice, volunteer work that is not listed as experience), professional organization memberships, and awards/recognition\nyou have received. This list should contain information that is relevant to the job for which you are applying or gives the\nemployer a better understanding of your character. You can have a separate section for each of these headers or you can\ncombine them as shown below. If you only want to describe one item header (e.g. only ACTIVITIES) that is fine as well.\nThe purpose of this section is to help the employer understand what sets you apart from other individuals with similar\neducation, experiences, and skills.\nACTIVITIES/HONORS/AFFILIATIONS\nPresident, STEM Club, Marymount University\nMember, National Association of Science and Technology Students\nPresidential Scholarship, U.S. Department of Education\nVolunteer, Helping Hands Homeless Shelter\n\n09/2012- Present\n09/2011 - Present\n05/2011\n05/2011 \xe2\x80\x93 09/2011\n\n2. Industry-Specific Section Headings\nIt is important to note that every industry has its own standards for resume writing. These general instructions are a\nfantastic guideline to get you started, but, to make the appropriate finishing touches, it would be best to check in with\nindustry professionals, professors, and your Career Services office to be sure you are covering all of the necessary\ninformation for your industry. There are some industry-specific resume examples in this document, but if you would like\nto view more resume samples, log on to Jobs4Saints and visit their Resume Gallery.\n\nCURRICULUM VITAE (CVs)\nA Curriculum Vitae in the United States is a special kind of resume-like document that is primarily used by college\nprofessors and individuals pursuing high-level education/research or executive careers. It is very similar to the traditional\nresume only it is much longer (no page limit) and includes additional sections for Research, Publications,\nTeaching/Training Experience, etc. It may also go into more detail than a traditional resume about the types of\naccomplishments a person has made. CVs in the US are highly tailored to each position and are written in a similar format\nto the resume, the difference being in length and additional section headings. For additional assistance in constructing a\nCV, please contact the Center for Career Services. It is important to note that many other countries (especially European\ncountries like the United Kingdom, France, etc.) refer to what Americans call a \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional resume\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cCV.\xe2\x80\x9d This\nmeans that if you are applying to a company in London, England, and they ask for a CV, they are really asking for your\ntraditional 1-2 page US resume with some additional information. For information about writing resumes for careers\nabroad, contact the Center for Career Services and/or the Center for Global Education.\n\nFEDERAL RESUMES\nFederal resumes are written similarly to public and private sector resumes, but differ in a few specific ways. The\nsection headings for a Federal resume are generally the same and experiences are described either in paragraphs or bullet\npoints. Here are the ways a Federal resume differs from other resumes:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Federal resumes have no page limit and are generally 3-5 pages long depending on experience\n\xef\x82\xb7 The OBJECTIVE section of a Federal resume contains the title and GS code for the position\n\xef\x82\xb7 Federal resumes contain significantly more personal information including your Social Security Number,\nCitizenship Status, Veteran\xe2\x80\x99s Status, and Security Clearances.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Experiences are described much more in depth and include information about your salary, hours worked,\naddress of company you worked at, supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s name and contact (and if it is all right to contact them)\n\xef\x82\xb7 There is no timeline limit for Federal resumes, you should include all work experiences regardless of\nrelevance.\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cSample Federal Resume\n\nPage 1\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cFederal Resume Sample\nPages 2 and 3\n\nFor more information on\nFederal resume writing,\ncontact:\nCenter for Career Services\n(703) 284-5960\ncareer.services@marymount.edu\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cResume Writing Tools and Samples\nTransferable Skills List\nManagement\nDecision-Making\nTechnical\nMulti-tasking\nEmotional Regulation\nInterpersonal Skills\nMotivating\nMediation\nCultural Sensitivity\nSupporting\n\nLeadership\nAnalysis\nFinancial\nOrganization\nConflict-Resolution\nPublic Speaking\nPersuasion\nCommunication\nLanguage\nMonitoring\n\nCritical Thinking\nEvaluation\nFacilitation\nAdministration\nProfessionalism\nResearch\nSelling\nProblem-Solving\nAssisting\nSupervising\n\nJudgment\nTeam Work\nTeaching\nManual Labor\nDevelopment\nPlanning\nPresenting\nWriting\nAssessment\nEmpathy\n\nAction Verb List\nAccomplished\nAddressed\nAided\nAscertained\nCentralized\nControlled\nDetected\nDirected\nEmployed\nEstimated\nExhibited\nFinalized\nFormed\nImplemented\nInterpreted\nLearned\nOrganized\nPrevented\nQuantified\nReasoned\nRecognized\nSalvaged\nStarted\nSupported\nTested\nVisualized\n\nAchieved\nAdministered\nAnalyzed\nAssessed\nCompared\nCoordinated\nDetermined\nDiscerned\nEnforced\nEvaluated\nExperimented\nFulfilled\nFound\nInnovated\nInvestigated\nMeasured\nPerceived\nProjected\nQuestioned\nRecruited\nRedesigned\nSaved\nStrategized\nSurveyed\nTranslated\nWeighed\n\nActed\nAdvanced\nAppraised\nAttained\nCompleted\nCultivated\nDeveloped\nDiscovered\nEnlisted\nExamined\nExplored\nForecast\nGenerated\nInitiated\nInspected\nMerged\nPredicted\nProved\nReached\nResearched\nReorganized\nSelected\nStudied\nSynthesized\nUndertook\n\nAdapted\nAdvised\nArranged\nAverted\nConducted\nDemonstrated\nDiagnosed\nDocumented\nEstablished\nExecuted\nFacilitated\nFostered\nIdentified\nInstituted\nLaunched\nObserved\nPrepared\nQualified\nReasoned\nReviewed\nResolved\nSolved\nSubstantiated\nSystemized\nVerified\n\nAdjective List\nSuccessful(ly)\nCompetent(ly)\nEfficient(ly)\nEffective(ly)\nStrong(ly)\nEnthusiastic(ly)\nSteady (ily)\nCareful(ly)\nSensitive(ly)\nImportant\nGracious(ly)\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\nModern\nRealistic(ally)\nVast(ly)\nAccurate(ly)\nAssertive(ly)\nHigh-level\nOrderly\nPractical(ly)\nDiscreet(ly)\nOptimal\nJudicious(ly)\n\nPowerful(ly)\nThoughtful(ly)\nAbsolute(ly)\nAggressive(ly)\nAuthentic(ally)\nImpartial\nProductive(ly)\nSavvy\nResponsible(ly)\nLasting\nCritical(ly)\n\n\x0cStandard Undergraduate Student Resume\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cInformation Technology Resume Sample\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cNursing Resume Template\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cStandard Graduate Resume Page 1\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cStandard Graduate Resume Page 2\n\nFor more resume samples by major/industry, login to Jobs4Saints and check out the Resume Gallery.\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cADDITIONAL RESUME WRITING RESOURCES AT THE CENTER FOR CAREER SERVICES\nIn addition to the information and examples this e-guide offers, the Center for Career Services also provides the following\nservices and materials to support the development of effective, tailored, resumes.

885,Engineering,"b'Undergraduate Resume Guide\nYour resume is an important tool to market your experiences to prospective employers. It is a professional written document that\ncommunicates your education, work experiences, and skills related to the type of position you are seeking.\n\nTO GET STARTED:\n1) Make a list of experiences you\xe2\x80\x99ve had: Education and training, jobs, internships, research, projects, volunteer work, leadership,\nstudent organizations, etc.\n1) Think about what you contributed, what skills you used and developed, and your significant achievements.\n2) Begin to craft your resume by organizing these experiences into sections (examples below).\nA resume should always include your contact information, education, and experience. Additional resume categories described\nbelow are common sections that may enhance your resume. Keep in mind that the resume you use to apply for a particular\nposition should address the skills and qualifications outlined in the job description, therefore your resume is a fluid document that\nshould continually change.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION:\nInclude your name, present and/or permanent address, telephone number, and email address.\nExample of Contact Section:\n\nGoldy Gopher\n7890 West Sixth Avenue\nAnytown, MN 55698\n444-444-1234\ngoldy@umn.edu\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nA brief statement that indicates what type of position you are seeking. It may also include key skills you bring to the position, which\ntype of industry you want to work in, and/or what company you want to work for. When applying for a specific position, tailor your\nobjective to match the qualifications of the job description and address the company\xe2\x80\x99s needs. If an employer requests a resume\nand cover letter, an objective statement is probably unnecessary as you are addressing your qualifications through the cover letter\nyou submit. If you chose to include an objective statement, make sure that it is well written and enhances your resume.\nExamples of Objective Statements:\nObjective: To obtain the mechanical engineering internship with XYZ company that will utilize my design experience and\ntechnical skills.\nObjective: Seeking a research and development internship with a biomedical company that will allow me to use my skills in\ncommunication, analytical thinking, and problem solving\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEDUCATION:\nInclude all institutions you have attended and are currently attending in reverse-chronological order (most recent first). Include:\nThe degree you are seeking, university name, college name, city and state of the university, your expected graduation date, and\nGPA. Coursework, academic awards, and study abroad programs may also be included in this section.

Generally, a bachelors level candidate\nshould stick to a one-page resume. If your resume is two pages, only print on one side of the paper, and your second page\nshould include your name and \xe2\x80\x9cPage 2.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAvoid using a resume template. This does not allow the opportunity to personalize and to make changes\xe2\x80\x94and your resume is\nan ever changing document.\nYour resume should be well organized, without spelling errors, and easy to read. An employer spends an average of 20-30\nseconds scanning your resume\xe2\x80\x94it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications.\nTo organize your resume, you may choose to use bold, italics, all caps, indenting, and bullets. You will want to use these\nsparingly to emphasize the most important information. Avoid pictures, graphics, non-black ink, shading, and symbols instead\nof traditional, round, solid bullet points.\nIt is a good idea to start with a one-inch margin on each side. You can expand the margins if need be. Your font size should be\nbetween 10-12 point, and you will want to choose easy-to-read font styles, such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Garamond.\nKeep your font size and style consistent throughout your resume (except for your name, which should be a larger size).\nPresent your resume on quality bond paper (20 pound)\xe2\x80\x94stick with white and off-white to ensure your resume is easy to read.\nIf you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your resume directly, keep the format simple when filling\nin the required information.\nIf you are requested to submit your resume via email, save your resume and cover letter (if applicable) as attachments. Include\na brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose.\n\nTIPS FOR RESUME WRITING:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nMake sure that your resume is a unique and personal document.

Please see the \xe2\x80\x9cResume Examples Binder\xe2\x80\x9d in the Resource Center.\nThere are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume, but there are also options and room for choice. If you give\nyour resume to several people, they may all give you different feedback. Beyond some of our strongly suggested guidelines,\nresumes are subjective.\nBe 100% honest and factual. Avoid abbreviations.\nOrganize your resume so the most relevant information is at the top.\nDo not include a work history. Rather, include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of\nskill.\nPersonal information, such as marital status, age, height, weight, etc. should not be included.\nAvoid personal pronouns (I, my, we) and complete sentences to describe your experiences. Start your statements with action\nverbs.\nReferences are a separate document from your resume. Reference documents should include your contact information as it\nappears on your resume. List the name, title, company name, address, phone, and email of each reference (see example on\nPg. 9).\nAlways proofread your resume. Do not solely rely on spell check. Some employers may eliminate candidates based on errors.\nIt is suggested to tailor your resume to the job description. You may have more than one version of your resume depending on\nthe positions you are applying for. Employers may do a key word search of the resumes submitted to find those that meet the\njob requirements.\nRemember that your resume is YOUR marketing tool. Many times it is an employer\xe2\x80\x99s first impression of you. It is also a work in\nprogress that you will continually revise.\n\nCURRICULUM VITAE (CV):\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nA CV is a type of resume most commonly used to apply for research or faculty positions in an academic setting.\nA CV is typically longer in length and provides more detail than a resume. In addition to the basics that you would include on a\nresume, it is common to include publications, presentations, research and teaching experiences, grants, fellowships, and\nawards.\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nVisit www.cse.umn.edu/career to view our Resume Writing Workshop\nVisit the Resource Center to view our Resume Examples Binder and related books\nHave your resume reviewed by a CSE Career Counselor. You can email it to csecareer@umn.edu. If you would like to meet with\na CSE Counselor to discuss, you can make a 30-45 minute appointment or stop by during Drop-In Advising and Career\nCounseling hours (paper copy only; no

903,Engineering,"b""Resumes\n\nfor Engineers\n\nWhat is a resume?\nA resume is a marketing brochure about you. It describes your skills, experience (paid and/or unpaid), and your\neducation. The purpose of an effective resume is to get you an interview.\nIs one resume good for all jobs?\nYour job search materials should be customized for each position. If your search is focused on one type of\nposition, a single version of your resume may be fine, along with a cover letter that is tailored to your\nemployment target. If you\xe2\x80\x99re applying to a wider range of positions, you may need to revise your resume in\naddition to creating a new cover letter. This customization is essential to your marketing and requires research\nabout the organization and industry.\nWhat is a chronological resume?\nThe chronological resume is a commonly used format for undergraduate students. The experience section of a\nchronological resume includes your positions, listed in reverse chronological order (beginning with your most\nrecent position and working backwards). Essential data includes: name of organization, location, your title, and\ndates of employment/involvement. This is followed by several bullets, describing your skills and achievements.\nHow is an engineering resume different than a liberal arts resume?\nAn engineering resume may include specialized section headings such as:\nTechnical Skills\nEngineering Experience\n\nLab Experience\nAcademic Experience\n\nLab Skills\nResearch\n\nRelevant Courses\nProjects or Design Projects\n\nAn engineer often includes academic work including a list of courses and relevant project work. This academic\nexperience might be listed before work experience, if they have not yet interned or worked in an engineering\nenvironment. Technical skills may also be listed at the top of the resume if required by the position.\nWhat else do I need to know about resumes?\n\xe2\x97\x8f Survive the human scan. Resumes get less than 30 seconds of an employer's time.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Survive the electronic scan. Make sure you have used appropriate jargon and keywords for your field.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Capture your reader\xe2\x80\x99s attention by keeping your resume to a single, easily \xe2\x80\x98skimmable\xe2\x80\x99 page. Check\nwith a Career Advisor about exceptions to the one-page rule.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Use good quality paper in colors such as white, off-white or neutral if submitting hard copy.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Check for typos, spelling errors, and grammar usage.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Include a customized cover letter that demonstrates how you match the employer\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.\nHow do I email my resume?\n\xe2\x97\x8f Email your resume and cover letter as one attachment (PDF format with your cover letter as page 1\nand resume as page 2).\n\xe2\x97\x8f When emailing your documents to employers, include your first initial and last name in the title of the\ndocument. When creating an appropriate subject line for your email, use your name and the position\nto which you\xe2\x80\x99re applying. For example: Civil engineering intern application from J. Barnum.\n\xc2\xb7 Include a short note in your email message to briefly introduce yourself, list the position to which you are\napplying, and indicate that you have attached your application to the email and look forward to\nconnecting with the employer to discuss your skills and experiences.\n\n~Please use Resume Checklist on following page to prepare your document~\nTufts Career Center | careers.tufts.edu | 617.627.3299 | Dowling Hall 740\n\n\x0cTufts Career Center | careers.tufts.edu | 617.627.3299 | Dowling Hall 740\n\n\x0cRESUME CHECKLIST\nFORMATTING & MECHANICS\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\n\nDocument fits on one page without overcrowding.

910,Engineering,"b""Resumes\n\nfor Engineers\n\nWhat is a resume?\nA resume is a marketing brochure about you. It describes your skills, experience (paid and/or unpaid), and your\neducation. The purpose of an effective resume is to get you an interview.\nIs one resume good for all jobs?\nYour job search materials should be customized for each position. If your search is focused on one type of\nposition, a single version of your resume may be fine, along with a cover letter that is tailored to your\nemployment target. If you\xe2\x80\x99re applying to a wider range of positions, you may need to revise your resume in\naddition to creating a new cover letter. This customization is essential to your marketing and requires research\nabout the organization and industry.\nWhat is a chronological resume?\nThe chronological resume is a commonly used format for undergraduate students. The experience section of a\nchronological resume includes your positions, listed in reverse chronological order (beginning with your most\nrecent position and working backwards). Essential data includes: name of organization, location, your title, and\ndates of employment/involvement. This is followed by several bullets, describing your skills and achievements.\nHow is an engineering resume different than a liberal arts resume?\nAn engineering resume may include specialized section headings such as:\nTechnical Skills\nEngineering Experience\n\nLab Experience\nAcademic Experience\n\nLab Skills\nResearch\n\nRelevant Courses\nProjects or Design Projects\n\nAn engineer often includes academic work including a list of courses and relevant project work. This academic\nexperience might be listed before work experience, if they have not yet interned or worked in an engineering\nenvironment. Technical skills may also be listed at the top of the resume if required by the position.\nWhat else do I need to know about resumes?\n\xe2\x97\x8f Survive the human scan.

911,Engineering,"b'HOW TO WRITE A PROFESSIONAL RESUME\n\n\x0c\x0cRESUME TIPS\nThe following tips are suggestions that you should consider when writing and sending your resume to prospective\nemployers:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nUse white or light colored paper in standard size (8 \xc2\xbd x 11 inches). Many office supply stores sell resume paper.\nBe sure to include a cover letter with mailed and emailed resumes. When you email a resume and cover letter,\ncreate a short introduction to use as your email body.\nThe resume should be easy to read, crisp, and have a consistent format.\nAlways keep your resume up-to-date!\n\nMany companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which scan resumes for key words and themes that\nmatch the job description. These words identify skills that the company is looking for to fill specific job postings. However,\ndue to the use of this software, there are specific ways a resume should be formatted so that it will scan properly in to the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s system.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nDo not use a template, invisible text boxes, special graphics, color, or shading. Always use a blank Microsoft Word\ndocument to create a text-only version of your resume for online submissions. Always submit your resume in a .pdf\nformat and save more creative versions of your resume to hand to an employer in person.\nUse standard, non-decorative fonts in black ink only. Font sizes should be 14-16pt for your name and 10-12pt for\nthe body of your resume.\nMargins should be equally set between .6 \xe2\x80\x93 1 inch on all sides.\nAvoid folding or stapling your resume. If your resume is more than one page, create a header and/or footer with\nyour name, contact information, and page number.\n\nKey words describe skills using nouns and action verbs and are very important in your resume. Companies usually\nindicate key skills they are looking for in the job posting.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nUse synonyms in your resume \xe2\x80\x93 if you use the word, \xe2\x80\x9cAttorney\xe2\x80\x9d, also use the word, \xe2\x80\x9cLawyer\xe2\x80\x9d.\nDo not use \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\xe2\x80\x9d, or other personal pronouns \xe2\x80\x93 simply begin statements with strong action verbs to\ndescribe what you did.\nKey words = experience + knowledge (be honest and do not exaggerate your skills).\n\nAlways proofread your resume before you send it!\n\n\x0cOBJECTIVES\nAn objective statement is a one or two line statement of your career or job search goal. It is used in place of a longer\nsummary, likely when a candidate has little to no experience related to their target position. Your objective should be\nspecific to the type of position or field that you\xe2\x80\x99re applying to and focus on what you can contribute to the position or\ncompany, not what you want or what you can gain from the experience.\nNOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY \xe2\x80\x93 DO NOT COPY.\n\nManagement:\nSeeking an entry-level management position with responsibilities including problem-solving, planning, organizing, and\nmanaging budgets.\nAdmin:\nAn administrative position in the area of rehabilitation and geriatric healthcare, utilizing knowledge of clinical, community,\nand patient services.\nTeaching:\nA position as an Elementary School Teacher that will utilize strong teaching abilities to create a nurturing, motivational, and\nstimulating learning environment to help children achieve their potential.\nCriminal Justice:\nSeeking a full-time position in the field of criminal justice where education, initiative to succeed, and desire to serve will be of\nvalue in administering and safeguarding criminal and judicial processes.\nTech Support:\nPosition utilizing training and hands-on experience in MIS, help-desk services, technical support, and customer service.\nAccounting:\nSeeking entry-level position as a Staff Accountant utilizing outstanding analytical, accounting, and leadership skills.\n\n\x0cSUMMARIES\nA summary takes the place of an objective statement when a candidate has relevant experience in the field to which they\nare applying. A summary is longer than an objective and highlights the desired position and a few relevant qualifications.\nNOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY \xe2\x80\x93 DO NOT COPY.\nSamples are based on examples presented in \xe2\x80\x9cModernize Your Resumes and Cover Letters\xe2\x80\x9d by Wendy Enelow and Louise Kursmark of The\nResume Writing Academy and Career Thought Leaders Consortium.\n\nMODERN STYLE:\n\nHealth and Social Service Manager\n\nMental Health Program Coordinator \xe2\x94\x82 Social Worker Case Manager\nBilingual (English-Spanish) healthcare leader delivering top-notch health and social service outreach in rural and\nurban communities since 2005\n\nForensic Science Technician\n\nPassion for Science and Discovery\nBS in Biology and Criminology \xe2\x80\x93 Experience collecting, identifying, classifying, and analyzing physical evidence\nthrough classroom projects, criminal investigation internship, and study abroad.\n\nProgrammer Analyst / Software Developer\n\nAnalytical Thinker with 5+ Years\xe2\x80\x99 Experience in the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Industry.\nTechnical Expertise Includes:\nCommand Interpreters \xe2\x80\xa2 MySQL software \xe2\x80\xa2 IEA Software Emerald \xe2\x80\xa2 Microsoft Access\nMicrosoft Visual Basic \xe2\x80\xa2 C++ \xe2\x80\xa2 Python \xe2\x80\xa2 HTML \xe2\x80\xa2 JavaScript\n\nAccounting & Finance\n\nTaxation & Audit \xef\x82\xa7 Financial Planning & Investment\nIntuit QuickBooks \xef\x82\xa7 ERP Software \xef\x82\xa7 Oracle PeopleSoft \xef\x82\xa7 MS Excel \xef\x82\xa7 HR Block Tax Software\nTRADITIONAL STYLE:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Outgoing and articulate, with excellent people skills.

Choose your most impressive courses; try to avoid listing the\nentry-level ones.\nThis section is best paired with the Academic Projects section. Together, both sections are an excellent way to utilize your\ndegree for your job goal.\nTo format the section, simply list your classes using multiple columns. Course numbers, descriptions, and grades are not\nnecessary.\nNOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY \xe2\x80\x93 DO NOT COPY.\n\nTWO COLUMN SAMPLE:\nRELEVANT COURSES\nFinancial Accounting\nCalculus\nMacroeconomics\n\nManagement Accounting\nBusiness Finance\nOrganizational Development\n\nTHREE COLUMN SAMPLE:\nRELEVANT COURSES\nDigital Circuits\nHardware Modeling\nVLSI Design\n\nInformation Security\nAdvanced Systems\nNumerical Analysis\n\nDigital Logic\nComputer Graphics\nAutomata Theory\n\n\x0cACADEMIC PROJECTS\nAcademic projects are used to demonstrate your knowledge of an area or industry when you have little or no experience.\nAnything done in class, except tests, can be presented as a project. Examples include presentations, papers, group work,\ncase studies, and research.\nAll academic projects should be written in active voice using the strongest action verbs possible. In this suggested format,\ninclude a title and keep the overview to two to three lines, providing only enough information so the prospective employer\ncan ask questions. If the project is too in-depth to present in two or three lines, use two or three bulleted statements instead\nof the paragraph format.\nNOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY \xe2\x80\x93 DO NOT COPY.\n\nSoftware Engineering Group Project\nDesigned library catalog web system using 3-tier, client-server model.

Ensured\nmeasurement and layout accuracy through careful architectural research.\n\n\x0cRESULT/ACCOMPLISHMENT STATEMENTS\nResult and accomplishment statements are used when describing previous experience to show the employer written proof\nof your results, achievements, and successes. They demonstrate what is unique about you and how you can add value to a\npotential position by citing specific examples. Simply listing duties or responsibilities from your job description are not\nenough \xe2\x80\x93 focus on what you actually did and how your efforts impacted your position, the project, or organization.\nTo help get you in the mindset of writing result and accomplishment statements, ask yourself some of these questions:\n\xef\x82\xb7 What was the purpose of this work? How was this work relevant to the organization?\n\xef\x82\xb7 What goals was I contributing to? What value or benefit did I add?\n\xef\x82\xb7 How did I go above and beyond basic job duties? Compared to others in my position, how did I stand out?\n\xef\x82\xb7 Did this work save time/money, increase customer satisfaction, design/improve a process or policy, etc? Did I\nachieve more with less; complete something ahead of schedule/budget?\n\xef\x82\xb7 Did I receive a promotion and/or recognition during my employment? Did I consistently maintain or hit above\npersonal or company goals or quotas?\nNOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY \xe2\x80\x93 DO NOT COPY.\n\nYou can develop result and accomplishment statements using several methods, which are described below:\nSOAR\nStatement of Action \xe2\x80\x93 What did you do? (Action verb)\nOccurrence of Action \xe2\x80\x93 How often action occurred/took place (daily, weekly, annually, etc.)\nAmount of Action \xe2\x80\x93 How much, how many? (20%, 50+, over 100, $1M, etc.)\nResult of Action \xe2\x80\x93 Result/outcome of efforts (increased, decreased, designed, saved, implemented, etc.)\nStatement \xe2\x80\x93 Managed a technical crew\nOccurrence \xe2\x80\x93 Managed a technical crew on a daily basis\nAmount \xe2\x80\x93 Managed a technical crew of over 20 people on a daily basis\nResult \xe2\x80\x93 Managed a technical crew of over 20 people, on a daily basis, that increased production 3 quarters in a row\nPAR/CAR\nProblem/Challenge \xe2\x80\x93 Problem/challenge/opportunity\nAction \xe2\x80\x93 Action taken to solve the problem\nResult \xe2\x80\x93 Result or outcome of your efforts\n\nSTAR\nSituation/Task \xe2\x80\x93 Situation or task at hand\nAction \xe2\x80\x93 Action taken\nResult \xe2\x80\x93 Result of action taken\n\nADDITIONAL RESULT/ACCOMPLISHMENT STATEMENT EXAMPLES:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Selected as Freshman Orientation Leader; acclimated 150 new students to college environment through guided\ntours of campus and presentations over a 3-day period.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Led 8-member team project that collected new hire data from 350 employers in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Redesigned company accounting and payroll systems by implementing new, electronic reporting system which\ndecreased turnaround time for reimbursements.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Trained over 200 new insurance agents in a 2-month time frame on the legal, ethical, and regulatory aspects of\ninsurance and securities sales.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Innovated blood drive volunteer system, which increased student and faculty participation by 20%.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Recognized and promoted to Assistant Sales Manager within 1 year for consistent customer service-oriented\nattitude, product knowledge, and leadership capabilities.\n\n\x0cTRANSFERABLE SKILLS\nYou have obtained many skills throughout your life: working, being a student, participating in extracurricular activities, and\neven personal experiences have all contributed to your skill set. Skills which can apply to many different jobs or areas are\ncalled transferable skills. They are especially handy to use if you have no relevant work experience or if you are changing\ncareer paths. Incorporating these into your work experience section will help showcase the applicable skills you have to\noffer the employer. Remember, simply listing that you have these skills is not enough. You must include how you used\nthese skills in order to prove you possess them, and show how they are relevant and applicable to the employer.\nBelow is a list of transferable skills to help you get started.\nCommunication\nSpeaking effectively\nListening attentively\nWriting concisely\nEditing\n\nProviding appropriate feedback\nPerceiving nonverbal messages\nFacilitating group discussion\nExpressing ideas\n\nNegotiating and persuading\nSpeaking a foreign language\nReporting information\nDescribing feelings\n\nResearch and Planning\nCreating ideas\nSetting goals\nForecasting\nAnalyzing\n\nExtracting information\nIdentifying resources\nDeveloping strategies\nPredicting outcomes\n\nGathering information\nSynthesizing data\nSolving problems\nDefining needs\n\nHuman Relations\nDeveloping rapport\nBeing sensitive\nCounseling\nAsserting\n\nPerceiving feelings and situations\nProviding support for others\nDelegating with respect\nConveying feelings\n\nRepresenting others\nCooperating\nMotivating\nListening\n\nOrganization, Management, and Leadership\nInitiating new ideas\nDecision making with others\nManaging groups\nDelegating responsibility\nManaging conflict\nSelling ideas or products\nCoaching\nHandling details\n\nCoordinating tasks\nPromoting change\nCounseling\nTeaching\n\nWork Survival\nBeing punctual\nMeeting goals\nCooperating\nOrganizing\n\nAttending to detail\nEnforcing policies\nMaking decisions\nEnlisting help\n\nSetting and meeting deadlines\nImplementing decisions\nAccepting responsibility\nManaging time\n\n\x0cTRANSFERABLE SKILLS: SAMPLES\nHere are some examples of how to use transferable skills to improve on basic job descriptions and prove to the employer\nthat you possess relevant job-related skills.

Does the idea of securing an entry-level job\nwith good long-term career growth appeal to you? If so, act now.\nThere is a lot that you can do to make such a position become a\nreality.\nStudies consistently show that the Number One factor in\nhelping college graduates transition to meaningful paid positions is\ncareer related experience.\nCareer related experience can be gained in a variety of ways.\nThese include internships (paid or unpaid), cooperative education,\nsummer positions, voluntary experience, and part-time jobs. All\nwork experience is valuable, but experience directly related to\none\xe2\x80\x99s long-term career goals is the most meaningful.\nThis booklet is designed to help you write a resume that can\nbe used while you are still an undergraduate. Hopefully, a good\nresume will help you obtain career-related experience before you\ngraduate.\n\n2\n\n\x0cINTERNSHIPS\nAt the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, the Office of\nCareer Services has been designated as the initial point of contact\nfor internships. Employers who are seeking interns from UPJ are\ndirected to this office. They work closely with academic\ndepartments and faculty to refer students to employers. If you are\ninterested in an internship, talk to your faculty advisor or visit the\nCareer Services Office.\n\nCOOPERATIVE EDUCATION\nCooperative Education is a formalized program where\nstudents alternate between semesters of full-time school and\nsemesters of full-time work. Co-op students normally have more\nthan one semester of co-op work experience prior to graduation.\nThe University\xe2\x80\x99s School of Engineering in Pittsburgh has a\nCooperative Education program through which UPJ\xe2\x80\x99s Engineering\nTechnology students can be placed in co-op positions. ET students\nwho are interested in co-op should see their faculty advisor.\n3\n\n\x0cTHE BIG \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x9d REFERRAL SYSTEM\n\nThe Big \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x9d program is a computerized job referral system\ndeveloped by Career Services to notify UPJ students of part-time\nand summer job opportunities. After job openings are received in\nthe Career Services Office, they are matched to the fields of\ninterest which are listed on the registration form. Once matches are\nmade, students are then sent a notice with a description of the job.\nIf the student is interested in the position, it is up to him/her to\ncontact the employer, usually by sending a resume and cover letter.\nRegister with the Big \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x9d in Career Services if you want to receive\nnotices about part-time and summer positions.\n\n4\n\n\x0cWHERE DO I LOOK FOR CAREER\nRELATED POSITIONS?\nBy referring to the directories seniors use in their full-time\njob hunt, you can start a list of all the companies for which you\nwould most like to work for. Most of the companies listed in\ndirectories are very large and/or nationwide, but obviously, they\nare also the companies that are able to conduct large summer\nhiring programs.\nBecause smaller companies do not hire in great volume, it\ncan be more difficult to seek them out, but do not rule them out. A\ngood rule to follow is: don\xe2\x80\x99t leave any stone unturned. Joe\nSchmo\xe2\x80\x99s Fish Market may need summer help to balance the books.\nA good place to look for summer positions is with the state or\nthe federal government. There are a vast number of opportunities\nin the many agencies. A good way to find out about these\nopportunities would be to check the websites;\nwww.usajobs.opm.gov and www.scsc.state.pa.us.\nThe best ways to find summer employment are to research,\nwrite letters, talk to as many people as you can, and distribute your\nresume as much as possible. Remember \xe2\x80\x93 Career Services can\nprovide you with a lot of good resources. It\xe2\x80\x99s to your advantage to\nutilize this office.\nAnd also, even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get a position that provides\nexperience in your profession, you can gain valuable\ncommunication and organizational skills simply by delivering\npizzas or waiting tables.\n\n5\n\n\x0cWHERE DO I LOOK FOR\nA SUMMER JOB?\nMany people don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that they have an effective job\nreferral system at their fingertips. This network uses no forms,\ncosts nothing, and has an amazing success rate \xe2\x80\x93 as high as 80\npercent. All you need to do to take advantage of this job network is\n\xe2\x80\x9cget the word out\xe2\x80\x9d to friends, relatives, professors, etc. Many jobs\nare found just by asking people you know to keep an eye out for\njob openings. Give your resume to these people. Ask them to\ncirculate it to those who might need a person with a background\nlike yours.\nWhen picking up and dropping off an application, or a\nresume (it\xe2\x80\x99s always best to do these things in person), look sharp.\nIf a person\xe2\x80\x99s appearance is sloppy and unkempt, a potential\nemployer will take an application and file it away under \xe2\x80\x9cNO\nWAY!\xe2\x80\x9d If the position requires that you complete an application,\nfill it out in blue or black ink, NEATLY. The appearance and\ncondition of your application could tell a great deal about you to an\nemployer. A great looking application may not get you a job, but a\nsloppy application will most certainly stop you from being hired.\nIf you are asked to interview for a position, make sure you\nare dressed properly. Neatness counts in any interview, so try to\nlook your best. Remove any facial piercing, cover tattoos, and\navoid extreme hairdos and clothing. Men should have facial hair\nneatly groomed. Women should use make-up conservatively.\nWhen interviewing for professional positions, professional\nattire is expected.\n\n6\n\n\x0cHOW RESUMES FOR\nUNDERGRADUATES DIFFER FROM\nTHOSE OF SENIORS AND ALUMNI\nWhereas college graduates typically do not include information from\ntheir high school years on their resumes, undergraduates may, and normally\ndo use such information. The younger you are, the more likely it is that you\nwill use information from your high school years.\nYour objective (if you include one) should say that you are seeking a\nsummer position, a part-time job, an internship, or a co-op position. You\nmay choose to include your QPA if it is average or above.\nIt may help to list the courses that you have taken (in high school or\ncollege) that relate to the position for which you are applying. It is generally\nadvisable to list your computer skills.\nEven though career related experience is most significant, all work\nexperience is valuable. If you mowed lawns, worked in fast food, baby sat,\netcetera, don\xe2\x80\x99t shy away from putting it on your resume.\nYour activities and interests can be a real asset. They can display a\ngreat deal about you. They show how active you are, how willing you are to\nserve others, and frequently indicate leadership traits and communication\nand organizational skills.\nYou should have at least three references. Those that you list as\nreferences should not be personal friends or family members. Teachers,\nprofessors, and supervisors from places at which you worked make the best\nreferences. List their name, title, place of employment, address, and\ntelephone number. References are normally typed on a separate sheet of\npaper and given to the employer upon request.\n\n7\n\n\x0cRESUME WRITING TIPS\nWriting a resume can be a daunting experience. The following is a\nlist of tips compiled from the advice of employers, career\ncounselors, and recent graduates whose resumes helped them land\nmeaningful employment.\n\xc2\x99 Pay careful attention to spelling, punctuation, grammar, and\nstyle.\n\xc2\x99 Proofread your resume carefully, using a dictionary and\nstylebook, and have several other people proofread it as well.\n\xc2\x99 Organize information in a logical fashion.\n\xc2\x99 Keep descriptions clear and to the point.\n\xc2\x99 Confine your information to one page.\n\xc2\x99 Use a simple, easy-to-read font.\n\xc2\x99 Use good-quality white or off-white bond paper.\n\xc2\x99 Include as much work experience as possible, even if it\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t obviously relate to the job you\xe2\x80\x99re seeking.\n\xc2\x99 Tailor your information to the job you\xe2\x80\x99re seeking.\n\xc2\x99 Seek help at your career services center.\nFor more information on preparing a resume and other jobsearch ideas, visit your career center.\nNational Association of Colleges and Employers\n\n8\n\n\x0cINFORMATION THAT APPEARS ON\nMOST RESUMES\n1.) Personal Information: Name, Campus/Permanent Addresses, Telephone Numbers,\nand an E-mail Address.\n2.) *Employment Goals: (This is normally called the \xe2\x80\x9cCareer Objective\xe2\x80\x9d or simply\n\xe2\x80\x9cObjective\xe2\x80\x9d). Describe the type of work you desire. The objective should reflect your\nshort-range plans. For those with little or no full-time work experience, the development\nof a concisely described job objective may be the most difficult task in compiling a\nresume.\nIf you find that a specific career objective is too confining, or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet your needs,\nthere are options available:\na.) You may decide to write your objectives in functional terms that describe the type of\nwork activities you prefer instead of a description or title.\nb.) Eliminate the employment goal section on your resume and incorporate your objective\nin your cover letter.\nc.) Have several resumes with different objectives that you would send to the appropriate\nemployers.\n3.) Education: Name of College(s), Location, Dates, Degree(s), Major(s), Quality Point\nAverage*, Honors, and perhaps courses of particular value if they are related to\nemployment for which you are applying. Whereas college graduates typically do not\ninclude high school background, undergraduates frequently find it advantageous to do so.\n4.) Skills: You may decide to include a section that lists your computer skills, foreign\nlanguages, licenses (CPR, commercial driving, etc.) and other skills.\n5.) Experience: Part-time employment, summer employment, applicable college\nprojects, internships, volunteer work. (This section may be divided into three areas:\ncareer-related experience, part-time employment, and summer experience). For\nundergraduates with little or no full-time professional level work experience, it is very\nimportant to include part-time and summer jobs\xe2\x80\x94even if the type of work has no bearing\non academic or career plans. Remember that career related experience is most valuable,\nbut a proven track record of other successful experience also makes you a more attractive\ncandidate.\nNOTE: It is much more important to emphasize what your experiences were\n(description, explanation) rather than when and where (dates, places).\n6.) Military Service: For those who have completed military obligations, the dates of\nactive duty and rank upon discharge should be included. When appropriate, include a\nbrief description of duties and responsibilities, particularly if the experience relates to\nfuture employment. If you do not have any military experience, omit this section.\n\n9\n\n\x0c7.) Activities and Interests: These include extra-curricular college and/or community\nexperiences, and any leadership positions. A brief listing of hobbies or avocations is\nacceptable. Teacher-education candidates should include all experiences working with\nchildren and adolescents. Candidates for teaching positions might choose to include their\nown high school activities.\n8.) *References: List 3 or 4 persons. Give name, professional title, business address,\nand business phone. These are normally listed on a separate sheet of paper. If you\ndecide not to list your references on your resume, you could indicate that \xe2\x80\x9cReferences are\navailable upon request.\xe2\x80\x9d Do not use personal friends and relatives as references.\nTeachers, faculty, and former supervisors make the best references.\n* indicates optional\n\nPlease Note:\nTraditional advice has been to use \xe2\x80\x9caction verbs\xe2\x80\x9d when writing resumes and\ncover letters. A list of \xe2\x80\x9caction verbs\xe2\x80\x9d you might consider using in your resume is\nprovided in the back of this booklet.\nAlthough the use of \xe2\x80\x9caction verbs\xe2\x80\x9d is still considered important, you also\nshould be aware of a recent trend. Many large organizations are using computers\nto do the first scanning of resumes. When scanned, these computers can quickly\nreview thousands of resumes. However, be aware that they normally scan for nouns\nnot verbs. Action verbs may have a greater effect when a human being does the first\nscanning of your resume, but verbs may not impress a computer.\nIn essence, both action verbs and important descriptive nouns that describe\nyour qualifications (such as titles or positions) are important.\n\n10\n\n\x0cSAMPLE RESUMES\n\nPlease use the following resumes as examples only.\nLook at all the resumes before you begin to\nconstruct your own. Your resume will serve you best\nif it is unique and highlights your own personal\nqualifications. Choosing a format that you like and\nthen blending bits and pieces of a variety of\nexamples will make your resume appear as if it is\noriginal. Resumes copied from somebody else or\nproduced from a template are normally not as\neffective as original resumes.\n\n11\n\n\x0cDuncan Donaldson\nDuncan444@upj.com\nHome Address\n84 Trueman Avenue\nAltoona, PA 15947\n(814) 555-8444\n\nCampus Address\nP.O.

Through this letter, you must make\nthe employer want to give you an interview. The cover letter\ncorresponds to the first five minutes of an interview, and your\nmanner and attitudes are conveyed as readily on paper as in person.\nTherefore, you must follow certain standards to carefully write\neffective cover letters. Some guidelines are the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Every cover letter should be individually typed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Quality paper should be used. (If your resume is on colored\npaper, your cover letter should be on matching paper.)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The letter must conform to good business style and be free of\nerrors.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The letter should be no more than one page in length\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The cover letter should indicate a special interest in the\norganization. Receiving a generic resume and letter gives the\nimpression that you distributed them indiscriminately to any\norganization that you pulled out of a hat.\nThese are some basic guidelines to preparing a cover letter.\nWhat follows are some examples of cover letters dealing with\ndirect solicitation to employers, response to newspaper ads, and\nreferral from the placement office. These are provided to give\nyou an idea of how cover letters are written; remember that the\nones you write should reflect your qualities to the potential\nemployer. DO NOT SIMPLY COPY THESE EXAMPLES \xe2\x80\x93\nBE CREATIVE!\n\n19\n\n\x0cReferral from Faculty Member or Other:\n701 Forbes Avenue\nPittsburgh, PA 15555\nMarch 25, 20_ _\nMs. Forest Mead\nPersonnel Director\nX-caliber Engineering Company\nWest Middlesex, PA 16656\nDear Ms. Mead\nI wish to be an applicant for internship with the X-caliber Engineering Company.

I was excited to read your ad since I\nhave had a long-time interest in pharmaceutical sales and your products sound particularly\nappealing to me.\nAs a college student, I had the opportunity to experience in sales and customer service. Of\nparticular interest to you, I worked at Glassboro Medical Supply serving customers who enter our\nstore. Through reading professional periodicals and magazines that are sent to me as an\nemployee of Glassboro Medical Supply, I have become knowledgeable of the different types of\nmedical supplies. This knowledge enables me to fully address our customers\xe2\x80\x99 medical supply\nneeds and answer their questions. Utilizing my proactive approach to sales and customer service,\nI increased sales this year by 20% over last year\xe2\x80\x99s figures. In light of my accomplishment, my\nsupervisor has given me the responsibility of developing a plan to market medical supplies to local\ndrug stores. In addition to my work experience, I recently completed a course in\ndrug/pharmacology terminology at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. Completion of\nthis course increased my knowledge of medicines and their effects.\nI have always had a strong interest in the medical/pharmaceutical sales field and have attempted\nto gain the knowledge and experience needed to work effectively in that capacity. With that in\nmind, I feel I am highly qualified for the position of sales representative for Savitz Pharmaceuticals.\nMy enclosed resume outlines my qualifications in further detail.

Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a\ngreat place to start when composing your resume. This list is a sampling of the types of\nskills you might highlight on your resume, in addition to those skills that are more\nspecific to your major, intended industry, or job function.\nA sampling of action verbs is also included on this page. Be sure to use strong action\nverbs to begin each of your bulleted statements, previewing the skill to be exemplified\nthrough the accomplishment statement.\n\nIV.\n\nChronological Resume Samples...\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6...Pages 6-11\nIn this most commonly accepted resume format, job titles and employers are\nemphasized, starting with your most recent experiences to illustrate a progressive work\nhistory. Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements\nunder each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently\ngraduated with a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree, those who are staying within the same career field,\nand candidates with few time gaps in their job history. This type is most often preferred\nby employers because it is easy to scan, highlights job titles, employers, and dates, and\nclearly ties candidates\xe2\x80\x99 skills and accomplishments to their work histories.\n\nV.\n\nFunctional & Combination Resume Samples...\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6..Pages 12-13\nThis format is an option for candidates who have changed employers frequently,\nhave gaps in their employment history, or are hoping to transition to a new industry\nor unrelated job function. Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight\ntransferable skills, placing less emphasis on employment dates, job titles, and\nemployers.\n\nVI.\n\nAdditional Career Center Resume Resources\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6...Page 14\n\n2\n\n\x0cI. Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics\nThe purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience,\nand skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume,\nthink of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect\ncandidate for the opportunity at hand.\nResume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best\npractices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content\nand a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with\nregard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify\nthe skills you possess and employers are seeking.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should\nkeep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing\nelements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the reader\xe2\x80\x99s eye to rest.\nUsing .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A\n10-12 point font size is recommended.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold\na job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers,\ndates, etc. line up neatly on the page.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully\nread through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least\n2-3 people proofread it as well.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when\nyou have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties,\nquantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry\nor job function-specific) and transferable skills.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the\nskill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily\nscan your resume for what he or she is seeking.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d at the beginning of each bullet point as this is\nassumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \xe2\x80\x9cMy duties included...\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMy responsibilities\nwere\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xef\x81\xb6 Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking.\nAlso, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your\nmost important information stands out.\n\n3\n\n\x0cII. Key Elements of a Successful Resume\nYour First and Last Name\n\xe2\x99\xa6 Phone number \xe2\x99\xa6 Email address \xe2\x99\xa6 Street address \xe2\x99\xa6 City, state & zip code \xe2\x99\xa6\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOBJECTIVE\nCreate a statement describing or naming the position you are seeking to obtain. You may also include the specific field or area\nyou are interested in and the skills and expertise you could contribute to the company. This section is optional and could be\nomitted or substituted with a \xe2\x80\x95Career Highlights\xe2\x80\x96 or \xe2\x80\x95Summary of Qualifications\xe2\x80\x96 section.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEDUCATION\nInstitution City, State\n(Expected) Graduation Month Year\nWrite out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations\nGPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher)\nOther possible information to include: Study Abroad experiences, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEXPERIENCE, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE [possible titles/descriptive headings]\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nThe position header above is one example of formatting. Other formats can include using two lines or rearranging the order of\nthe Organization, Job Title, Location, and Dates to emphasize the most important elements.\nYou can bold or italicize your title or your organization\xe2\x80\x94whichever is more relevant, but be consistent.\nIn this section include bulleted accomplishment statements, which provide examples of times you have successfully used the\nskills employers are seeking.\nStart with a strong action verb, then follow with an explanation of what you were doing, describe how you did it, and, when\npossible, include any outcomes that you achieved. Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or\nmore skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them.\nConsider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work?\nWhat were your accomplishments? How did you help the organization? What skills/knowledge did you enhance? How does\nthis experience relate to your internship/employment goal?\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nBulleted statements should be in the proper tense (past or present tense) and use consistent grammar and punctuation.\nBe specific by including quantity, frequency, population, and impact of your work whenever possible.\nMake sure your resume is easy to read and not too text heavy. Avoid using colors, multiple fonts, pictures, being too brief, or\nmaking it too dense. Make it your own, but be professional.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, LEADERSHIP, HONORS, ACTIVITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE, VOLUNTEER,\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT [possible titles/descriptive headings]\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nUsing multiple experience sections is optional and allows you to emphasize (by placing it closer to the top) your most relevant\nexperience. Experiences within a section should be listed in reverse chronological order.\nPositions within this section should be formatted like previous experience sections, but may or may not include bullet points.\nIn an additional experience section, you can include work experiences that may not be directly related to the job you are\napplying to, but add to your credibility by exemplifying a progressive work history.\nEmphasize your transferable skills, those that can be taken from one experience and applied elsewhere.\nOrganization, Your Role (e.g. Member, Participant, Honoree, or Presenter) \xe2\x80\x93 City, State Month Year - Month Year\nThis section can also be an opportunity to share your experiences as a leader, honors received, community involvement,\nprofessional development activities, or membership in organizations. As illustrated, replace \xe2\x80\x95job title\xe2\x80\x96 with the role you played.\nIncluding bullet points is optional, depending on what you wish to convey to a potential employer.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nADDITIONAL SKILLS [List skills that are testable and concrete. Soft skills such as communication, organizational, and\ninterpersonal skills should not be listed here, but rather incorporated into your bulleted accomplishment statements above.]\nTechnology: Try to include programs that would not be assumed based on education and include your proficiency level. For\nexample: Advanced User of Microsoft Office Suite, including Outlook, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as Adobe Photoshop.\nLanguages: For example: Proficient in oral and written German; Beginner knowledge of Spanish.\n\n4\n\n\x0cIII. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs\nTRANSFERABLE SKILLS\nTransferable skills are those that can be applied in multiple work settings. Consider incorporating them, in addition to those\nthat are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your\nbulleted accomplishment statements.

Over the years you have developed many skills through your\ncoursework, extracurricular activities, and life experiences. Review the list below and identify which transferrable skills you have\nand reflect on how you acquired these skills. Use this information when creating your resume to describe your experiences and the\nskills gained from these experiences. For example, if you have researched a topic for class and then wrote, edited, and presented a\nfinal research paper in front of your peers, you have used skills (gathering information, writing, problem-solving, presenting) which\nare not limited to that specific academic discipline, but are transferable to many occupations.\n\nResearch and\nplanning\n\nHuman relations\n\nOrganizing,\nmanagement and\nleadership\n\nWork survival\n\nThe skillful expression\nand interpretation of\nknowledge and ideas.\n\nThe search for specific\nknowledge and the ability\nto conceptualize future\nneeds and solutions.\n\nThe use of interpersonal\nskills for resolving\nconflict, relating to and\nhelping people.\n\nAbility to supervise and\nguide individuals and\ngroups in the\ncompletion of goals.\n\nThe daily skills that\nassist in promoting\neffective production and\nwork satisfaction.\n\nSpeaking effectively\n\nPredicting\n\nDeveloping\nrelationships\n\nInitiating new ideas\n\nImplementing decisions\n\nWriting effectively\n\nCreating theories and\nideas\n\nBeing sensitive\n\nHandling details\n\nCooperating\n\nIdentifying problems\n\nListening\n\nCoordinating tasks\n\nEnforcing policies\n\nImagining alternatives\n\nConveying feelings\n\nManaging groups\n\nBeing punctual\n\nIdentifying resources\n\nProviding support\n\nDelegating\nresponsibility\n\nManaging time\n\nGathering information\n\nMotivating\n\nTeaching\n\nSolving problems\n\nSharing credit\n\nPerceiving non-verbal\nmessages\n\nCoaching\n\nSetting goals\n\nCounseling\n\nAdvising\n\nPresenting information\n\nExtracting information\n\nCooperating\n\nPromoting change\n\nAccepting\nresponsibility\n\nDescribing feelings\n\nDefining needs\n\nDelegating with respect\n\nInterviewing\n\nDeveloping evaluations\n\nRepresenting others\n\nSelling ideas or\nproducts\n\nSetting and meeting\ndeadlines\n\nEditing\n\nCreating spreadsheets\nand databases\n\nPerceiving feelings,\nsituations\n\nDecision making with\nothers\n\nOrganizing\n\nCommunication\n\nListening attentively\nExpressing ideas\nFacilitating discussions\nNegotiating\nPersuading\n\nCalculating results\n\nAsserting\n\nAttending to detail\nMeeting goals\nEnlisting help\n\nMaking decisions\nManaging conflict\n\nPage 3\n\n\x0cACTION VERBS:\nAction verbs are an effective way to begin a skills statement.

Generally a graduate resume\nshould be 2-3 full pages and a CV should be 3-5 pages long. However, based on your experiences, career field, and the position\ndescription, it could be longer or shorter. Whatever the case, only print your document on one side of the paper and include\nyour name and the page number at the top of each page.\nAvoid using a resume or CV template. This decreases your ability to personalize and make changes as your document evolves.\nYour resume or CV should be well organized, without spelling errors, and easy to read. An employer spends a short amount of\ntime reading your document\xe2\x80\x94it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications.\nTo organize your document, you may choose to use bold, italics, all caps, indenting, and bullets. You will want to use these\nsparingly to emphasize the most important information. Avoid pictures, graphics, non-black ink, shading, and symbols instead\nof traditional, round, solid bullet points.\nIt is a good idea to start with a 1-inch margin on each side. You can expand the margins if need be. Font size should be\nbetween 10-12 point, and you will want to choose easy to read font styles, such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Garamond.\nKeep font size and style consistent throughout your CV (except for your name, which should be a larger size).\nPresent your resume or CV on quality bond paper (20 pound)\xe2\x80\x94choose white or off-white to ensure your document is easy to\nread.\nIf you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your document directly, keep the format simple when\nfilling in required information.\nIf you are requested to submit your documents via email, save your resume or CV and cover letter (if applicable) as attachments. Include a brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose.\n\nTIPS FOR RESUME AND CV WRITING:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nMake sure that your resume or CV is a unique and personal document. It is a great idea to look at examples of resumes or CVs\nbut also important to make it your own.\nThere are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume or CV, but there are also options and room for choice. If\nyou give your document to several people, they may all give you different feedback. Beyond some of our strongly suggested\nguidelines, resumes and CVs are subjective.\nBe 100% honest and factual. Avoid abbreviations.\nOrganize your document so the most important information is at the top.\nDo not include a work history. Rather, include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of\nskill.\nPersonal information, such as marital status, age, ethnicity, height, and weight should not be included.\nAvoid personal pronouns (I, my, we) and complete sentences to describe your experiences. Start your statements with action\nverbs.\nAlways proofread your resume or CV. Do not solely rely on spell check. Some employers may eliminate candidates based on\nerrors.\nIt is suggested that you tailor your resume or CV to the job description. You may have more than one version of your\ndocument depending on the positions to which you are applying . You may change the order of sections to list more relevant\nareas of your experience closer to the top.\nRemember that your resume or CV is YOUR marketing tool. Many times it is an employer\xe2\x80\x99s first impression of you. It is also a\nwork in progress that you will continually revise.\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nVisit www.ccse.umn.edu to view our Resume Writing or Curriculum Vitae Workshops.\nVisit the CSE Career Center Resource Center to view our Resume Examples Binder and related books.\nHave your resume or CV reviewed by a CSE Career Counselor. You can email to ccse@umn.edu. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to meet with a\nCSE Career Counselor to discuss your application materials, you can make a 30-45 minute appointment or stop by during\nDrop-In Advising and Counseling hours (paper copy only;

Does the idea of securing an entry-level job\nwith good long-term career growth appeal to you? If so, act now.\nThere is a lot that you can do to make such a position become a\nreality.\nStudies consistently show that the Number One factor in\nhelping college graduates transition to meaningful paid positions is\ncareer related experience.\nCareer related experience can be gained in a variety of ways.\nThese include internships (paid or unpaid), cooperative education,\nsummer positions, voluntary experience, and part-time jobs. All\nwork experience is valuable, but experience directly related to\none\xe2\x80\x99s long-term career goals is the most meaningful.\nThis booklet is designed to help you write a resume that can\nbe used while you are still an undergraduate. Hopefully, a good\nresume will help you obtain career-related experience before you\ngraduate.\n\n2\n\n\x0cINTERNSHIPS\nAt the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, the Office of\nCareer Services has been designated as the initial point of contact\nfor internships. Employers who are seeking interns from UPJ are\ndirected to this office. They work closely with academic\ndepartments and faculty to refer students to employers. If you are\ninterested in an internship, talk to your faculty advisor or visit the\nCareer Services Office.\n\nCOOPERATIVE EDUCATION\nCooperative Education is a formalized program where\nstudents alternate between semesters of full-time school and\nsemesters of full-time work. Co-op students normally have more\nthan one semester of co-op work experience prior to graduation.\nThe University\xe2\x80\x99s School of Engineering in Pittsburgh has a\nCooperative Education program through which UPJ\xe2\x80\x99s Engineering\nTechnology students can be placed in co-op positions. ET students\nwho are interested in co-op should see their faculty advisor.\n3\n\n\x0cTHE BIG \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x9d REFERRAL SYSTEM\n\nThe Big \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x9d program is a computerized job referral system\ndeveloped by Career Services to notify UPJ students of part-time\nand summer job opportunities. After job openings are received in\nthe Career Services Office, they are matched to the fields of\ninterest which are listed on the registration form. Once matches are\nmade, students are then sent a notice with a description of the job.\nIf the student is interested in the position, it is up to him/her to\ncontact the employer, usually by sending a resume and cover letter.\nRegister with the Big \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x9d in Career Services if you want to receive\nnotices about part-time and summer positions.\n\n4\n\n\x0cWHERE DO I LOOK FOR CAREER\nRELATED POSITIONS?\nBy referring to the directories seniors use in their full-time\njob hunt, you can start a list of all the companies for which you\nwould most like to work for. Most of the companies listed in\ndirectories are very large and/or nationwide, but obviously, they\nare also the companies that are able to conduct large summer\nhiring programs.\nBecause smaller companies do not hire in great volume, it\ncan be more difficult to seek them out, but do not rule them out. A\ngood rule to follow is: don\xe2\x80\x99t leave any stone unturned. Joe\nSchmo\xe2\x80\x99s Fish Market may need summer help to balance the books.\nA good place to look for summer positions is with the state or\nthe federal government. There are a vast number of opportunities\nin the many agencies. A good way to find out about these\nopportunities would be to check the websites;\nwww.usajobs.opm.gov and www.scsc.state.pa.us.\nThe best ways to find summer employment are to research,\nwrite letters, talk to as many people as you can, and distribute your\nresume as much as possible. Remember \xe2\x80\x93 Career Services can\nprovide you with a lot of good resources. It\xe2\x80\x99s to your advantage to\nutilize this office.\nAnd also, even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get a position that provides\nexperience in your profession, you can gain valuable\ncommunication and organizational skills simply by delivering\npizzas or waiting tables.\n\n5\n\n\x0cWHERE DO I LOOK FOR\nA SUMMER JOB?\nMany people don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that they have an effective job\nreferral system at their fingertips. This network uses no forms,\ncosts nothing, and has an amazing success rate \xe2\x80\x93 as high as 80\npercent. All you need to do to take advantage of this job network is\n\xe2\x80\x9cget the word out\xe2\x80\x9d to friends, relatives, professors, etc. Many jobs\nare found just by asking people you know to keep an eye out for\njob openings. Give your resume to these people. Ask them to\ncirculate it to those who might need a person with a background\nlike yours.\nWhen picking up and dropping off an application, or a\nresume (it\xe2\x80\x99s always best to do these things in person), look sharp.\nIf a person\xe2\x80\x99s appearance is sloppy and unkempt, a potential\nemployer will take an application and file it away under \xe2\x80\x9cNO\nWAY!\xe2\x80\x9d If the position requires that you complete an application,\nfill it out in blue or black ink, NEATLY. The appearance and\ncondition of your application could tell a great deal about you to an\nemployer. A great looking application may not get you a job, but a\nsloppy application will most certainly stop you from being hired.\nIf you are asked to interview for a position, make sure you\nare dressed properly. Neatness counts in any interview, so try to\nlook your best. Remove any facial piercing, cover tattoos, and\navoid extreme hairdos and clothing. Men should have facial hair\nneatly groomed. Women should use make-up conservatively.\nWhen interviewing for professional positions, professional\nattire is expected.\n\n6\n\n\x0cHOW RESUMES FOR\nUNDERGRADUATES DIFFER FROM\nTHOSE OF SENIORS AND ALUMNI\nWhereas college graduates typically do not include information from\ntheir high school years on their resumes, undergraduates may, and normally\ndo use such information. The younger you are, the more likely it is that you\nwill use information from your high school years.\nYour objective (if you include one) should say that you are seeking a\nsummer position, a part-time job, an internship, or a co-op position. You\nmay choose to include your QPA if it is average or above.\nIt may help to list the courses that you have taken (in high school or\ncollege) that relate to the position for which you are applying. It is generally\nadvisable to list your computer skills.\nEven though career related experience is most significant, all work\nexperience is valuable. If you mowed lawns, worked in fast food, baby sat,\netcetera, don\xe2\x80\x99t shy away from putting it on your resume.\nYour activities and interests can be a real asset. They can display a\ngreat deal about you. They show how active you are, how willing you are to\nserve others, and frequently indicate leadership traits and communication\nand organizational skills.\nYou should have at least three references. Those that you list as\nreferences should not be personal friends or family members. Teachers,\nprofessors, and supervisors from places at which you worked make the best\nreferences. List their name, title, place of employment, address, and\ntelephone number. References are normally typed on a separate sheet of\npaper and given to the employer upon request.\n\n7\n\n\x0cRESUME WRITING TIPS\nWriting a resume can be a daunting experience. The following is a\nlist of tips compiled from the advice of employers, career\ncounselors, and recent graduates whose resumes helped them land\nmeaningful employment.\n\xc2\x99 Pay careful attention to spelling, punctuation, grammar, and\nstyle.\n\xc2\x99 Proofread your resume carefully, using a dictionary and\nstylebook, and have several other people proofread it as well.\n\xc2\x99 Organize information in a logical fashion.\n\xc2\x99 Keep descriptions clear and to the point.\n\xc2\x99 Confine your information to one page.\n\xc2\x99 Use a simple, easy-to-read font.\n\xc2\x99 Use good-quality white or off-white bond paper.\n\xc2\x99 Include as much work experience as possible, even if it\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t obviously relate to the job you\xe2\x80\x99re seeking.\n\xc2\x99 Tailor your information to the job you\xe2\x80\x99re seeking.\n\xc2\x99 Seek help at your career services center.\nFor more information on preparing a resume and other jobsearch ideas, visit your career center.\nNational Association of Colleges and Employers\n\n8\n\n\x0cINFORMATION THAT APPEARS ON\nMOST RESUMES\n1.) Personal Information: Name, Campus/Permanent Addresses, Telephone Numbers,\nand an E-mail Address.\n2.) *Employment Goals: (This is normally called the \xe2\x80\x9cCareer Objective\xe2\x80\x9d or simply\n\xe2\x80\x9cObjective\xe2\x80\x9d). Describe the type of work you desire. The objective should reflect your\nshort-range plans. For those with little or no full-time work experience, the development\nof a concisely described job objective may be the most difficult task in compiling a\nresume.\nIf you find that a specific career objective is too confining, or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet your needs,\nthere are options available:\na.) You may decide to write your objectives in functional terms that describe the type of\nwork activities you prefer instead of a description or title.\nb.) Eliminate the employment goal section on your resume and incorporate your objective\nin your cover letter.\nc.) Have several resumes with different objectives that you would send to the appropriate\nemployers.\n3.) Education: Name of College(s), Location, Dates, Degree(s), Major(s), Quality Point\nAverage*, Honors, and perhaps courses of particular value if they are related to\nemployment for which you are applying. Whereas college graduates typically do not\ninclude high school background, undergraduates frequently find it advantageous to do so.\n4.) Skills: You may decide to include a section that lists your computer skills, foreign\nlanguages, licenses (CPR, commercial driving, etc.) and other skills.\n5.) Experience: Part-time employment, summer employment, applicable college\nprojects, internships, volunteer work. (This section may be divided into three areas:\ncareer-related experience, part-time employment, and summer experience). For\nundergraduates with little or no full-time professional level work experience, it is very\nimportant to include part-time and summer jobs\xe2\x80\x94even if the type of work has no bearing\non academic or career plans. Remember that career related experience is most valuable,\nbut a proven track record of other successful experience also makes you a more attractive\ncandidate.\nNOTE: It is much more important to emphasize what your experiences were\n(description, explanation) rather than when and where (dates, places).\n6.) Military Service: For those who have completed military obligations, the dates of\nactive duty and rank upon discharge should be included. When appropriate, include a\nbrief description of duties and responsibilities, particularly if the experience relates to\nfuture employment. If you do not have any military experience, omit this section.\n\n9\n\n\x0c7.) Activities and Interests: These include extra-curricular college and/or community\nexperiences, and any leadership positions. A brief listing of hobbies or avocations is\nacceptable. Teacher-education candidates should include all experiences working with\nchildren and adolescents. Candidates for teaching positions might choose to include their\nown high school activities.\n8.) *References: List 3 or 4 persons. Give name, professional title, business address,\nand business phone. These are normally listed on a separate sheet of paper. If you\ndecide not to list your references on your resume, you could indicate that \xe2\x80\x9cReferences are\navailable upon request.\xe2\x80\x9d Do not use personal friends and relatives as references.\nTeachers, faculty, and former supervisors make the best references.\n* indicates optional\n\nPlease Note:\nTraditional advice has been to use \xe2\x80\x9caction verbs\xe2\x80\x9d when writing resumes and\ncover letters. A list of \xe2\x80\x9caction verbs\xe2\x80\x9d you might consider using in your resume is\nprovided in the back of this booklet.\nAlthough the use of \xe2\x80\x9caction verbs\xe2\x80\x9d is still considered important, you also\nshould be aware of a recent trend. Many large organizations are using computers\nto do the first scanning of resumes. When scanned, these computers can quickly\nreview thousands of resumes. However, be aware that they normally scan for nouns\nnot verbs. Action verbs may have a greater effect when a human being does the first\nscanning of your resume, but verbs may not impress a computer.\nIn essence, both action verbs and important descriptive nouns that describe\nyour qualifications (such as titles or positions) are important.\n\n10\n\n\x0cSAMPLE RESUMES\n\nPlease use the following resumes as examples only.\nLook at all the resumes before you begin to\nconstruct your own. Your resume will serve you best\nif it is unique and highlights your own personal\nqualifications. Choosing a format that you like and\nthen blending bits and pieces of a variety of\nexamples will make your resume appear as if it is\noriginal. Resumes copied from somebody else or\nproduced from a template are normally not as\neffective as original resumes.\n\n11\n\n\x0cDuncan Donaldson\nDuncan444@upj.com\nHome Address\n84 Trueman Avenue\nAltoona, PA 15947\n(814) 555-8444\n\nCampus Address\nP.O.

Through this letter, you must make\nthe employer want to give you an interview. The cover letter\ncorresponds to the first five minutes of an interview, and your\nmanner and attitudes are conveyed as readily on paper as in person.\nTherefore, you must follow certain standards to carefully write\neffective cover letters. Some guidelines are the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Every cover letter should be individually typed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Quality paper should be used. (If your resume is on colored\npaper, your cover letter should be on matching paper.)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The letter must conform to good business style and be free of\nerrors.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The letter should be no more than one page in length\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The cover letter should indicate a special interest in the\norganization. Receiving a generic resume and letter gives the\nimpression that you distributed them indiscriminately to any\norganization that you pulled out of a hat.\nThese are some basic guidelines to preparing a cover letter.\nWhat follows are some examples of cover letters dealing with\ndirect solicitation to employers, response to newspaper ads, and\nreferral from the placement office. These are provided to give\nyou an idea of how cover letters are written; remember that the\nones you write should reflect your qualities to the potential\nemployer. DO NOT SIMPLY COPY THESE EXAMPLES \xe2\x80\x93\nBE CREATIVE!\n\n19\n\n\x0cReferral from Faculty Member or Other:\n701 Forbes Avenue\nPittsburgh, PA 15555\nMarch 25, 20_ _\nMs. Forest Mead\nPersonnel Director\nX-caliber Engineering Company\nWest Middlesex, PA 16656\nDear Ms. Mead\nI wish to be an applicant for internship with the X-caliber Engineering Company.

955,Engineering,"b'CHEMISTRY R\xc3\x89SUM\xc3\x89S\n1. There is no absolute right format. This is your personal work, so create a resume that represents you well and that\nyou like. However, be sure that you follow basic guidelines:\nA. Make sure your resume says the most about you in the fewest number of words (one page is recommended for\nBachelor\xe2\x80\x99s level students, 2 pages for graduate students\xe2\x80\xa6but there are some exceptions, e.g. more than ten\nyears of employment experience).\nB. Be consistent with your format! Margins, bolding, capitalization, and style must be consistent as well as order\nand style of information.\nC. Proofread for typing and spelling accuracy.\n2. Only items leading directly to setting up an interview should be included. Keep your resume specific to the job\nyou are applying for, even if that means having different resumes for different jobs. (E.g. one resume for researchrelated positions and another for sales positions.) Salary requirements, supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s names, abbreviations, clich\xc3\xa9s,\nreasons for leaving jobs, personal opinions and personal information such as height, weight, age, marital status,\netc. should be excluded.\nA. Required Categories: (Heading) Name, Address, Phone Number (Note: Be sure your phone number is\nprominent. Employers who cannot find--or read--your telephone number will not call!),\nEmail Address; (Body) Education, Experience (Work and/or Activities).\nB. Optional Categories: (Body) Objective, Relevant Coursework, Honors & Awards, Activities, Credentials,\nSkills, Computer Skills, Publications or Presentations, Professional Affiliations, and\nOther.\n3. If you do include an objective, be sure that it shows your career goals. It must be narrow and specific and include\nyour strengths as they apply to the position. (E.g. To obtain a position as a Chemical Engineer at a growing\ncompany where I can use my research abilities and excellent communication skills to create advanced products in\na team setting.)\n4. Both the resume and cover letter should be examples of your best work! Maintain a positive tone by excluding\nnegative aspects of your experience.\n5. Choose a conservative font such as Helvetica, Times, Courier, Geneva, New York, Palatino, or a sans serif font no\nsmaller than 10 and no larger than 14. Include as much \xe2\x80\x9cwhite space\xe2\x80\x9d as possible for easier scanning by the\nemployer.\n6. Make your resume look professional. If you make a hard copy, use only a laser printer on good quality bond\npaper. Use white, off white, or a light blue or gray, 8-1/2"" X 11"" bond paper. (Remember that your potential\nemployer may photocopy your resume, so be sure that the paper is not too dark or \xe2\x80\x9cblotchy\xe2\x80\x9d to photocopy well!).\n7. Be specific with dates, job titles, employers, interests, and accomplishments. Be complete and descriptive without\nbeing too long. Always be completely accurate and truthful!\n8. Use what is called telegraphic style. Omit all personal pronouns (I, we, they, you, etc.) Use incomplete sentences\nin list form (no paragraphs!) without punctuation.\n9. Use results oriented, \xe2\x80\x9caction verbs\xe2\x80\x9d in describing your experience. Words such as administered, coordinated,\ndeveloped, created, implemented, managed, and prepared are keys in telling employers what you have\naccomplished. Use past tense unless you are describing a job you are currently doing (in which case present tense\nor past tense is acceptable). Career Services has additional recommendations for action verbs.\n10. Do not staple, paper clip, fold, or put your resume in a folder. Use the larger 9"" X 12"" envelopes to mail and be\nsure watermarks, if your paper has them, are right-side up.\n\nFor more information or assistance with a r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 or other job search question, please contact us at:\nSchool of Chemical Sciences Career Counseling & Placement Services\n105 Noyes Laboratory\n217-333-1050 \xe2\x80\xa2 plblum@illinois.edu \xe2\x80\xa2 http://careers.scs.illinois.edu/\n\n\x0cEXAMPLE 1: Entry-Level BS Chemist\n\nJOHN T.

Highlight your strengths, but always follow up statements ab\nout your competencies ( \xe2\x80\x98 I have advanced technical skills\xe2\x80\x99) with a specific example.\n\nQuestions to ask yourself\n1. Does this resume stand up to the brand I wish to convey to employers?\nYour resume is a marketing presentation of you. It is a document with a purpose and summarizes\nyour education, experience, and skills in short, concrete, result-oriented phrases that puts together\nthe right picture of you.\n2. Which three people can I show this to for a variety of responses and constructive criticism?\nYou need a resume that can appeal to different pairs of eyes and people are subjective so be sure\nto gather various opinions during your editing process.\n3. What should I put in the cover letter rather than in the resume?\nThe cover letter is an opportunity to introduce yourself in full sentences and should explain how\nyou learned about the position and why you are interested and qualified for the role in comparison\nto a resume which highlights the tasks and responsibilities of your work and educational experience\nin bullet points. Also note, there is a difference between a formal 3-4 paragraph cover letter and an\nemail introduction to the prospective employer. The email form should be a brief 1 paragraph note\nthat pulls from the first and last paragraph of your formal cover letter and should be edited and\nreviewed thoroughly for errors before hitting send!\n\nIngredients for a Knock-out Resume\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nKeep your resume to one page.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUse an attractive and professional layout.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCatch the reader\xe2\x80\x99s attention in 15 seconds.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStart each bullet point with an active verb\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMake everything positive on your resume. Your resume should convey a sense of vitality and an\nimage of you progressing smoothly and confidently through your career rather than having bumps.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTailor your resume to a job description whenever possible. Identify the five main qualities in the\ndescription and make sure those five qualities or as many as you can describe that are clearly\ndemonstrated in your resume.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHighlight achievements, rather than listing everything you have done.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAvoid raising unanswered questions and don\xe2\x80\x99t leaving gaps in your resume. Whether you served in\nthe military or did some traveling while unemployed or took a sabbatical, include a brief description\nto set the tone of a continued career progression\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProofread \xe2\x80\x93 not just spell/grammar check!

986,Engineering,"b'CHEMICAL ENGINEERING R\xc3\x89SUM\xc3\x89S\n1. There is no absolute right format. This is your personal work, so create a resume that represents you well and that\nyou like. However, be sure that you follow basic guidelines:\nA. Make sure your resume says the most about you in the fewest number of words (one page is recommended for\nBachelor\xe2\x80\x99s level students, 2 pages for graduate students\xe2\x80\xa6but there are some exceptions, e.g. more than ten\nyears of employment experience).\nB. Be consistent with your format! Margins, bolding, capitalization, and style must be consistent as well as order\nand style of information.\nC. Proofread for typing and spelling accuracy.\n2. Only items leading directly to setting up an interview should be included. Keep your resume specific to the job\nyou are applying for, even if that means having different resumes for different jobs. (E.g. one resume for researchrelated positions and another for sales positions.) Salary requirements, supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s names, abbreviations, clich\xc3\xa9s,\nreasons for leaving jobs, personal opinions and personal information such as height, weight, age, marital status,\netc. should be excluded.\nA. Required Categories: (Heading) Name, Address, Phone Number (Note: Be sure your phone number is\nprominent. Employers who cannot find--or read--your telephone number will not call!),\nEmail Address; (Body) Education, Experience (Work and/or Activities).\nB. Optional Categories: (Body) Objective, Relevant Coursework, Honors & Awards, Activities, Credentials,\nSkills, Computer Skills, Publications or Presentations, Professional Affiliations, and\nOther.\n3. If you do include an objective, be sure that it shows your career goals. It must be narrow and specific and include\nyour strengths as they apply to the position. (e.g. To obtain a position as a Chemical Engineer at a growing\ncompany where I can use my research abilities and excellent communication skills to create advanced products in\na team setting.)\n4. Both the resume and cover letter should be examples of your best work! Maintain a positive tone by excluding\nnegative aspects of your experience.\n5. Choose a conservative font such as Helvetica, Times, Courier, Geneva, New York, Palatino, or a sans serif font no\nsmaller than 10 and no larger than 14. Include as much \xe2\x80\x9cwhite space\xe2\x80\x9d as possible for easier scanning by the\nemployer.\n6. Make your resume look professional. If you make a hard copy, use only a laser printer on good quality bond\npaper. Use white, off white, or a light blue or gray, 8-1/2"" X 11"" bond paper. (Remember that your potential\nemployer may photocopy your resume, so be sure that the paper is not too dark or \xe2\x80\x9cblotchy\xe2\x80\x9d to photocopy well!).\n7. Be specific with dates, job titles, employers, interests, and accomplishments. Be complete and descriptive without\nbeing too long. Always be completely accurate and truthful!\n8. Use what is called telegraphic style. Omit all personal pronouns (I, we, they, you, etc.) Use incomplete sentences\nin list form (no paragraphs!) without punctuation.\n9. Use results oriented, \xe2\x80\x9caction verbs\xe2\x80\x9d in describing your experience. Words such as administered, coordinated,\ndeveloped, created, implemented, managed, and prepared are keys in telling employers what you have\naccomplished. Use past tense unless you are describing a job you are currently doing (in which case present tense\nor past tense is acceptable). Career Services has additional recommendations for action verbs.\n10. Do not staple, paper clip, fold, or put your resume in a folder. Use the larger 9"" X 12"" envelopes to mail and be\nsure watermarks, if your paper has them, are right-side up.\n\nFor more information or assistance with a r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 or other job search question, please contact us at:\nSchool of Chemical Sciences Career Counseling & Placement Services\n105 Noyes Laboratory\n217-333-1050 \xe2\x80\xa2 plblum@illinois.edu \xe2\x80\xa2 http://careers.scs.illinois.edu/\n\n\x0cEXAMPLE 1: Entry-Level BS Chemical Engineer\n\nJOHN T.

Specific to\nengineering, through my academic project work I have developed abilities in 3-D design and\nmodeling, an understanding of materials, and have practiced different manufacturing\ntechnologies. For example, in my Machine Design and Manufacturing course, I along with two\nteammates created mechanical drawings and designs in SolidWorks. We then modeled,\nmachined and assembled the parts of a working Stirling engine, meeting or exceeding all\nrequirements and deadlines. I have also developed the strong interpersonal and\ncommunication skills required to succeed as the R&D Product Development intern; in addition\nto academic team projects that require collaboration and strong writing and presentation skills,\nI have been selected by my peers for a leadership role within Penn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s Formula SAE team this\nyear, and am an active member of our ASME chapter. Throughout all of my experiences, I have\nused my dedication to efficient and creative problem solving and my ability to prioritize and\nmanage competing demands to positive ends. I am eager to apply my engineering knowledge\nand skills at the Consumer Products Company.\nI am very interested in interviewing for this opportunity and look forward to learning more\nabout your requirements. Attached, please find my resume for your consideration; it contains\nnot only a further description of my Stirling Engine project, but a more in-depth review of other\nrelated projects and experiences that I would be glad to discuss with you. Please feel free to\ncontact me at (215) 000-0000 or by email at student@upenn.edu. Thank you very much for\nyour consideration.\nSincerely,\nSarah Student\nAttachment (1)'"
